The sad thing about high interest is that it's always the people who can least afford it who are charged rates so high that it amounts to usury.

Nowadays, a typist typically uses a computer keyboard.Once upon a time, typists did all their typing on typewriters, but that's extremely unusual in today's era of computers and printers. Starting around 1884, a typist was ""a person who operates a typewriter,"" although earlier the word meant ""compositer,"" or the person who arranges type in a printing press. Typist comes from type, which derives from the Greek root typos, ""dent, impression, or mark.""typist: typists/antitype: antitypes/type: antitype, typed, types, typic, typify, typing, typist/typification: typifications/typify: typification, typified, typifies, typifying    typist"

Another kind of thoughtfulness describes deliberate thinking before doing something. It might, for example, require some thoughtfulness to figure out how to hook up your new TV. The word comes from the adjective thoughtful, which originally meant ""moody or anxious,"" but came to mean ""considerate"" in the 1850's.thoughtfulness: thoughtfulnesses/forethought: forethoughtful, forethoughts/forethoughtful: forethoughtfully, unforethoughtful/rethink: rethinking, rethinks, rethought/think: rethink, thinkable, thinker, thinking, thinks, thought/thinkable: thinkably, unthinkable/thinker: thinkers/thinking: thinkingly, thinkings, unthinking/thought: forethought, thoughtful, thoughtless, thoughts, unthought/thoughtful: thoughtfully, thoughtfulness, unthoughtful/thoughtless: thoughtlessly, thoughtlessness/thoughtlessness: thoughtlessnesses/unthinkable: unthinkably/unthinking: unthinkingly/unthoughtful: unthoughtfully, unthoughtfulness    thoughtfulness"

The pitched roof on your cabin means that snow slides right off in the winter time.You're almost always going to see the adjective pitched describing the angle of a roof. The sharply pitched roof on your grandparents' house might make the attic particularly charming, and the barely pitched roof of your garden shed could lead to a leaky situation in heavy rainstorms. Pitched comes from the sense of pitch that means ""slope or inclination,"" but beyond that its origin is unknown.pitch: pitched, pitcher, pitches, pitching, pitchy/pitcher: pitcherful, pitchers/pitcherful: pitcherfuls/pitching: pitchings/pitchy: pitchiest    pitched"

Some artists also use lithography to print images.Unlike other forms of printmaking that involve carving a plate or block that's then coated with ink, in lithography the metal or stone plate is coated with a waxy material. Text or images are carved out of this coating and spread with an oily ink that only adheres to the coated surface. Maps, prints, newspapers, and many other items (often with both images and text) are printed this way.

People who have guile are also thought of as being wily (which is also a related word), sneaky, and deceitful.

Criminals, pirates, and bullies are all frequently called dastardly. An unprovoked military strike is also sometimes described as dastardly, referencing President Franklin Roosevelt's famous 1941 speech after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which he called an ""unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan."" In the 1500s, dastardly meant ""dull,"" from the now-obsolete dastard, ""one who is lazy or dull.""dastardly: dastardliness/dastard: dastardly, dastards    dastardly"

Callooh! Callay!' He chortled in his joy."" Experts consider the word a blend of the words chuckle and snort and the laugh itself is also a cross between the two.

Some players bunt so that another runner can get from second to third base.The bunt is a rarely-used technique in baseball. When a batter bunts, the ball doesn't travel far — there's basically no chance that a bunt will result in a home run, for example. It forces the fielders to run forward, which can sometimes be an advantage for the team that's at bat.

A zinger is a sharp, funny remark that takes the listener by surprise. A zinger isn’t just a snappy comeback or insult, it’s a clever play on words.Dorothy Parker, an American writer (1893-1967), is queen of the zingers. Some favorites: “The first thing I do in the morning is brush my teeth and sharpen my tongue” and “Beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes clean to the bone.” Zingers tend to be funny, and they're often quick, sharp, and even a little mean. Friends often trade zingers as they playfully make fun of each other. Zingers are also called quips or one-liners.zinger: zingers   zinger

So, you probably wouldn't use bashful to describe a quiet, reserved coworker with whom you have little contact; shy would be a better fit. However, bashful is a perfect description for your good friend who unfortunately becomes tongue-tied whenever she tries to talk to strangers.bashful: bashfulest, bashfully, bashfulness   bashful

Instead of writing 1/2, for example, you can express the fraction as the decimal 0.5, where the zero is in the ones place and the five is in the tenths place.Decimal comes from the Latin word decimus, meaning tenth, from the root word decem, or 10. The decimal system, therefore, has 10 as its base and is sometimes called a base-10 system. Decimal can also specifically refer to a number in the decimal system. As an adjective, decimal means something related to this numbering system.

While gravity is specifically the pull of an object toward the Earth, gravitation describes this fundamental force more generally.

If you traveled to China and complained about everything that was unfamiliar and talked about how much better things are back home, you'd be guilty of chauvinism.While the main meaning of chauvinism is an exaggerated sense of patriotism, or being convinced that your country is vastly better than any other, the word is most familiar in the sense of male chauvinism. When it's used this way, it means a belief that men are better than women. The word comes from a Napoleonic soldier, Nicholas Chauvin, who was famous for his extreme patriotism — in other words, his chauvinism.chauvinism: chauvinisms, chauvinist, chauvinistic/chauvinist: chauvinists/chauvinistic: chauvinistically    chauvinism

This term was often used in a derogatory way — especially by Christians — for faiths that existed before Jesus. The term pagan is related to the Latin word for “rural” because country people held on to the old religions for longer. In paganism, polytheism — a group of gods — was more common than the monotheism that followed.

You can also call the painting that results from using these paints a gouache. The word simply means ""watercolor"" in French, from the Latin root aquatio, ""watering place.""gouache: gouaches   gouache"

No matter how you spin the rings, the disc stays flat.  In the 1850s, a French physicist used a gyroscope to explain how the Earth rotates on its axis.

Even in modern times, if you’re a marauder you’re certainly a rascal — probably even a criminal. A marauder doesn’t target a victim and plan a crime — instead a marauder is on the move looking for opportunities to rob people or steal things.

The water that collects there is also called bilge. Since bilge is dirty and smelly, the word is also slang for “nonsense.”On a large ship, some water inevitably ends up in the part that’s below the water line, the bilge. Because the bilge tends to sit there for a long time, sloshing around and mixing with oil, chemicals, waste, and cleaning products, it tends to stink. Periodically, the bilge is pumped out so the ship doesn't get too heavy and sink. Bilge is thought to be a variation on bulge, originally ""wallet or bag,"" and later ""ship's hull.""bilge: bilged, bilges, bilging, bilgy   bilge"

An abdication is a type of resignation.When a king — or another person in power — gives up that position, they abdicate. Such an act is then called an abdication. The roots of this word mean declare in Latin, and that's an important part of the meaning. Abdicating isn't just quitting: it's formally quitting, including a declaration of quitting. There’s no such thing as a private abdication. After an abdication, there's a vacuum of power, and there may be a power struggle to fill the empty position.abdication: abdications/abdicate: abdicable, abdicated, abdicates, abdicating, abdication, abdicator    abdication

Another kind of hulk is a big person, like the Incredible Hulk who could single-handedly sink the hulk of any ship.Hulks were once commonly used as prisons — floating jails where convicted criminals were kept. Ships become hulks when they're retired due to age, or damaged in a storm. Another meaning of hulk, ""enormous person,"" is rooted in this ship meaning, coming from the sense of either type of hulk as big, awkward, and clumsy.
