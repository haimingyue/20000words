The prefix in- means “in” and caro means “flesh,” so incarnate means “in the flesh.” The word can be used in positive or negative situations, but it always describes an unusual, possibly miraculous instance in which something that can’t normally be seen or touched assumes a bodily form.

Mugger comes from the verb mug, or ""beat up,"" which originally meant ""punch in the face,"" from the nickname mug, or ""face.""mugger: muggers/mug: mugful, mugged, muggee, mugger, mugging, mugs/mugful: mugfuls/muggee: muggees/mugging: muggings    mugger"

You can swindle money, goods, ideas, and anything else that can be stolen, but be careful, because someone can also swindle you.In the late 1700s, the verb swindle formed from swindler, which means “giddy person, cheat.” Swindle can be a noun or a verb. When you get something by less than honest means, that’s a swindle. A successful act of swindle often involves some scheme or rigging of the system. Hollywood loves a good swindle — think of all the movies that show a bank robbery or people lying about who they are.  Another funny word for swindle is bamboozle.swindle: swindled, swindler, swindles, swindling/swindler: swindlers    swindle

The prefix in- means “in” and caro means “flesh,” so incarnate means “in the flesh.” The word can be used in positive or negative situations, but it always describes an unusual, possibly miraculous instance in which something that can’t normally be seen or touched assumes a bodily form. For example, the Christian religion was founded on the belief that Jesus was God incarnate.incarnate: disincarnate, incarnated, incarnates, incarnating, incarnation, reincarnate/disincarnate: disincarnated/incarnation: incarnations/reincarnate: reincarnated, reincarnates, reincarnating, reincarnation/reincarnation: reincarnationism, reincarnations    incarnate

That’s why it’s in the word miniscule too, right? Wrong. It’s there because enough people spelled the word incorrectly that dictionary editors have given in. The traditional spelling is minuscule, with a u instead of a second i; minuscule is derived from the Latin word minus meaning “less.” Sticklers are surely convinced that the newfangled spelling illustrates the miniscule amount of respect that English speakers have for their own language.miniscule    miniscule

It's a version of ham that's sliced paper-thin after being dry-cured for a very long time, a process that involves salting the meat heavily. When you eat prosciutto, you're actually eating raw meat, since it's aged instead of cooked. The strong, salty flavor lends this Italian delicacy to antipasto plates and pizza toppings.

Wherever you go, you're reminded of the ubiquity of crows.ubiquity: ubiquities, ubiquitous/ubiquitous: ubiquitously, ubiquitousness    ubiquity"

If your favorite show ends its season with a cliffhanger, you'll have to wait months to find out what happens next.The key to a good cliffhanger is a character in some precarious position — this keeps the plot exciting, and it also ensures that the audience will return to see how dilemmas are resolved. In the case of a book, a cliffhanger keeps you turning the pages. The use of cliffhangers goes back to Homer's ""Odyssey,"" though the word itself dates from 1937, from serial movies that would sometimes literally leave characters dangling from a cliff at the end.cliffhanger: cliffhangers   cliffhanger"

Like the inedible middle of an apple or your inner circle of core friends.In the late 14th century, the noun core came about from the Old French coeur, meaning “core of fruit” and more literally, “heart.” So the core of something is its very heart, whether you're talking about the seed-containing center of a fruit, the central meaning of a book, or the core courses you need to take in order to graduate.core: cored, cores, coring   core

Prior to that, the word evolved from the Hebrew kĕrūḇ, and was taken from the Aramaic kĕ-raḇyā which meant ""child-like.""

There's always tin and copper in pewter, and it once commonly included lead, which we now know is dangerous for humans to consume.

You don't have to be a canine though; you might grovel for a better grade (please don't).If you grovel you risk getting the opposite of what you want, because people (like teachers) don't like people down at their feet begging for something. But if you cheat on your date, you may have to grovel to get him or her back. Grovel also means to crawl around on your belly — you could grovel on gravel, but that might really hurt.

The word originates from the Middle English word liste which meant desire (and is related to our word lust). Oddly enough, listen comes from the same origin.

The word is used for other kinds of forgiveness too.When you sin or make a mistake, you usually want absolution — which is like forgiveness. In many religions, if you confess your sins, you can be granted absolution: the sin is forgiven, forgotten, wiped clean. Usually, the sinning person has to do some kind of penance to atone for the sin to achieve absolution. Absolution is a serious concept: if you jaywalked, you probably won't worry about absolution.

Instead of writing 1/2, for example, you can express the fraction as the decimal 0.5, where the zero is in the ones place and the five is in the tenths place.Decimal comes from the Latin word decimus, meaning tenth, from the root word decem, or 10. The decimal system, therefore, has 10 as its base and is sometimes called a base-10 system. Decimal can also specifically refer to a number in the decimal system. As an adjective, decimal means something related to this numbering system. The decimal point, for example, refers to the period that separates the ones place from the tenths place in decimal numbers.decimal: decimalise, decimalize, decimally, decimals/decimalise: decimalisation/decimalize: decimalization, decimalized, decimalizes, decimalizing    decimal

Insinuation evolved from the Latin insinuationem, meaning ""entrance through a narrow way.”  So an insinuation is like an insult that sneaks in the back door.

The end of a romantic relationship that's less than amicable might involve broken dishes or broken bones.Amicable, not surprisingly, comes from the Latin word for ""friend,"" amicus.

If you've ever studied Latin, you'll spot the fi from fidare""to trust"" that inspired the Marines' ""semper fi"" motto and the popular moniker for pooches––""Fido."" Combining fi with de- negates it. So an act of defiance is essentially an act of not trusting.defiance: defiances/defiant: defiance, defiantly/defy: defiant, defied, defies, defying    defiance"

If you find living in a small town confining, you probably feel claustrophobic, like there's not enough room there for you and your aspirations.The -fin- in confining is the same root that's found in words such as the French word fin, meaning ""end"" or ""limit."" The con- is the familiar Latin suffix that means ""together."" So when something is confining, it's like a border drawn around you. In some cases, confining can be a good thing, like when your efforts at confining the fire to the kitchen saved the rest of the house.confine: confined, confinement, confines, confining/confined: confinedly, unconfined/confinement: confinements/unconfined: unconfinedly    confining"

It's considered a disorder to sleepwalk because normally your sleeping brain keeps you from performing actions like walking (even when you dream that you're walking). In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, there is a famous scene in which Lady Macbeth sleepwalks because of her guilty conscience.sleepwalk: sleepwalked, sleepwalker, sleepwalking, sleepwalks/sleepwalker: sleepwalkers    sleepwalk

Spitting on a cross, drawing pictures in the Qur’an, tripping a rabbi—all of these are rude in general, but because they combine a sacred religious person or thing with rude behavior, they're also blasphemous.  Beyond religion, any attack on something you cherish is blasphemous, like when your best friend says your celebrity crush is ugly.

And if you live off someone else's generosity, taking handouts and giving nothing in return, you sponge off of them.sponge: sponged, spongelike, sponger, sponges, sponging, spongy/sponger: spongers/spongy: spongier, spongily, sponginess    sponge

The word is fun to say, a favorite of children pretending to be cars. It suggests a kind of merry, or at least chipper, sensibility.Speaking of merriment, toot can also refer to a night of drinking and carousing. Light, fun drinking: think 1920s flappers dancing in fountains, not hardcore alcoholics with bottles in paper bags. It's the car behind you letting you know the light has changed or the cheerful sound of a tugboat asking larger ships to make way. Even ""tooting your own horn"" is just not that serious — it's a lighthearted spin on the otherwise obnoxious act of bragging.toot: tooted, tooting, toots   toot"
