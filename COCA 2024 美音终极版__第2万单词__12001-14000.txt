Cement is an ingredient in both mortar, which holds bricks together, and concrete, with which dams and roads and buildings are constructed.Cement begins as a powder made of clay and limestone, and after it's mixed with water and, often, sand, it's used to strengthen and bind things — as the mixture dries, it becomes hard and solid. A version of cement has been around since the third century BCE, in Mesopotamia. The word comes from the Latin root cæmenta, ""stone chips for making mortar,"" from caedere, ""to cut or chop.""cement: cemented, cementing, cements   cement"

A belief in individualism also implies that you believe that the government should bud out of your individual affairs.The concept of individualism is rooted in historical contexts where people’s personal differences were dismissed or even punished by the ruling body. In particular, the United States is known for having a strong bent towards individualism because it was founded by people who sought the freedom to practice whatever religion they chose. The counterpoints to individualism are socialism and communism (among others). Those who prefer individualism often site fear of governmental control over their life decisions as reason for that inclination.individualism: individualisms, individualist, individualistic/individual: individualise, individualism, individuality, individualize, individually, individuals/individualise: individualisation, individualised, individualises, individualising/individualist: individualists/individualistic: individualistically/individuality: individualities/individualization: individualizations/individualize: individualization, individualized, individualizes, individualizing    individualism

On Super Bowl Sunday, the shopping mall might be deserted — everyone is home, watching the game.desert: deserted, deserter, desertification, deserting, desertion, deserts, semidesert/deserter: deserters/desertion: desertions    deserted

A treatise is usually about a serious subject, so you might read a treatise on democracy, but you probably won't read a treatise about chewing gum.The word treatise is related to the verb treat, in the sense of ""deal with,” like the way a doctor treats a patient. Like a doctor, a treatise examines a subject from all angles. It has nothing to do with treats, unless you’re writing a treatise on desserts, which would be weird. More appropriate topics for a treatise include philosophy, religion, economics, and so forth.

Taken individually, the birthday wishes are nice but an onslaught is too many, too fast, all at once. Onslaught can also mean a sudden and severe start of trouble. For example, if your office is unprepared for the onslaught of flu season, the entire sales force will be home sick at the same time.onslaught: onslaughts   onslaught"

If, however, they unclog a sink by having a wrench in one hand and a how-to book in the other, then they may have the technique, but they probably don't have the knack.knack: knacks   knack

A utopia is an ideal society, and a scheme or vision for producing such a society can be called utopian.In 1516, the English philosopher Thomas More published Utopia, a book about an island nation with the perfect form of government. This novel gave us the adjective utopian, which  can be used to describe plans for or works of fiction depicting ideal societies. Dystopian literature, by contrast, describes nightmarishly repressive worlds. It's ironic that More himself may have conceived of his Utopia as a dystopia, or at least a satire. The name of More's novel is anglicized Greek for ""no place"" — which makes a lot of sense if you think about it.utopia: utopian, utopias   utopian"

While many people infected with polio had no symptoms at all, it did cause paralysis in some, and resulted in death for others.

Money, for instance, is convertible because it can be changed from one currency to another — for example, from dollars to euros. A sofa bed is convertible because it can be transformed from a sofa into a bed.

To pander is to appease or gratify, and often in a negative, self-serving way.The word pander began its infamous history as the name of various characters. Pandaro was a character in Boccaccio’s Filostrato. Pandarus was a character in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, as well as in Shakespeare’s Troilus and Cressida. These literary works all tell the tale of star-crossed lovers, and the namesake of pander is, essentially, a go-between whose motives don't seem entirely pure.pander: pandered, panderer, pandering, panders/panderer: panderers    pander

A large aperture means only one tiny point of the photo will be in sharp focus, while a small aperture means that much of the background as well as the foreground will be in focus.aperture: apertures   aperture

But when an animal leaps onto its prey, that's pouncing. When we talk about how people pounce, however, we're usually talking more figuratively. When we say that a person pounced on another person, we mean that they attacked viciously without warning — usually giving the victim no time to defend themselves. Lawyers pounce on witnesses, for example. If you feel suddenly ganged-up on, you might feel pounced upon.pounce: pounced, pounces, pouncing   pounce"

What these words all share in common is an origin in the Latin word centum, meaning 100. In the case of the adjective centennial, the addition of -ennial gives the word its sense of describing a one hundred year anniversary.centennial: bicentennial, centennials, semicentennial/bicentennial: bicentennials    centennial

It's celebrated differently around the world and can include the baking of a ""king cake,"" gift giving, singing, and grand parades.

You can still use noted this way, but it more commonly means ""renowned.""noted: notedest, notedly, unnoted/notability: notabilities/notable: notability, notables, notably/note: notable, noted, notes, noting    noted"

Other boardwalks are much larger commercial areas, often even built with concrete rather than wood. One famous boardwalk, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, gives tourists a place to gamble, eat, drink, and buy souvenirs.

For example, to make things as unbiased as possible, judges of an art contest didn't see the artists' names or the names of their schools and hometowns.You are unbiased if you can assess situations with a completely open mind. The root of unbiased is bias, which probably comes from the Greek word epikarsios, meaning “athwart,” “crosswise,” or “oblique.” When you have a bias, you look at the situation “from the side,” such as the side of someone who personally hates seafood telling you that Lobster Larry's is a terrible restaurant. To be unbiased you don't have biases affecting you; you are impartial and would probably make a good judge.unbiased: unbiasedly/bias: biased, biasedly, biases, biasing, biasly, biassed, biassing/biased: unbiased/biassed: unbiassed    unbiased

The most common use is when someone — like a teacher — asks a question that no one can answer. That's a case of the teacher stumping the class. Also, politicians traveling through a district, making speeches are stumping, giving what are called stump speeches. Once in a while, to stump means the same thing as two similar words, stomp and stamp. If you're stumping, stomping, and stamping around, you're making a lot of noise with your feet.stump: stumped, stumper, stumping, stumps/stumper: stumpers/stumping: stumpings    stump

Good luck.)When you've got a serious dilemma — say your two best friends aren't speaking to each other — it's usually helpful to ask an open-minded person for advice. Open-minded people can consider a problem from both sides, without injecting their own opinions or biases, and can often point you in the right direction.

To build allegiance, members of a sorority might wear the same sweatshirts with Greek letters and attend social events and regular club meetings.sorority: sororities   sorority"

There the noun blonde is used to mean a person (a woman) with light-colored hair and skin. So you can either say, “She is blonde,"" or “She is a blonde,” and they mean the same thing — that she has fair hair. When describing a male's yellowish hair or light-colored stained wood, you will more often see blond without the silent ""e"" at the end.

If you want to be a medalist, you'll need to practice your skills at the high jump, start a heroic military career, or become a champion speller.medalist: medalists/medal: medalist, medalled, medalling, medals    medalist

It's a type of turtle that lives on land all the time — so bring your pet tortoise in the sandbox with you, but not in the pool!A tortoise is a turtle, but a turtle isn't necessarily a tortoise! While most turtles are excellent swimmers and spend much of their time in the water, tortoises are full-time land dwellers. Their shells are more rounded than those of the typical turtle, and they don't have webbed feet. These are adaptations that help tortoises thrive on land, although they are notoriously slow (think ""The Tortoise and the Hare"").tortoise: tortoises   tortoise"

A bad stomachache can leave you bent over, making soft moans.Moan is also a verb, so whenever someone is hurting enough — physically or mentally — there's the possibility they'll moan in despair or discomfort. You can also use this word to mean ""whine"" or ""complain,"" like when your little sister moans about how much smaller her slice of pie is than yours. Experts think moan is related to the Old English word mænan, ""complain or moan,"" but that it's also imitative — resembling the sound it describes.moan: moaned, moaner, moaning, moans/moaner: moaners    moan"
