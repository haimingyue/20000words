The movie character Forest Gump made a silly analogy famous: ""Life is like a box of chocolates.""   Some standardized tests still have ""analogy questions,"" which are given in this format: A : B :: C : ___ (read ""A is to B as C is to what?""). This is a more formalized version of something we do every day: compare one thing to another. It's a useful way of speaking — if a scientist explains that the earth's forests function as its lungs, we understand the analogy to mean that both trees and lungs take in important elements from the air. But when Forrest Gump says life is like a box of chocolates because you never know what you're going to get, that's a pretty brainless analogy.          ★☆☆☆☆   1[N-COUNT 可数名词]相似；类似；类推；类比 If you make or draw an analogy between two things, you show that they are similar in some way.    [oft N between/with n]It is probably easier to make an analogy between the courses of the planets, and two trains travelling in the same direction.将行星的运行比作两列火车朝同一方向行驶可能更容易些。"

News organizations regularly recognize the anniversaries of important people's births and deaths, plus anniversaries of significant news events and national tragedies, like Sept. 11 2001 or Dec. 7, 1941. This word comes from Latin; remember that annus means year and you can relate the word to annual.

An antique is a nice, old piece of furniture, that's usually been well taken care of and costs more than something new. Shopping for antiques is called antiquing.

""The train's arrival is apparent — it's in the station — but apparently my friend missed it because she is not getting off.""   It makes sense that apparent has the same ancient root as appear because it's about what is plain to see. Its subtle power of suggestion, however, is wonderfully useful. The ""heir apparent"" technically means next in line, but the ink isn't dry. The power of apparent is that it leaves the door open for a little ambiguity. Maybe the heir apparent will be the next king, or maybe he'll be overthrown in a bloodless coup by his apparently more ambitious cousin.          ★★★☆☆   1[ADJ 形容词]貌似的；表面上的；似乎真实的 An apparent situation, quality, or feeling seems to exist, although you cannot be certain that it does exist.

(1) 该书末尾处有一附录。 (2) 这是调查报告的附件。 (3) 详细情况在一个附录里清楚列出。 (4) 他的阑尾割去了。 (5) 那个大夫说阑尾对我们来说并不重要。                No, it's not just a tiny organ pouch that requires surgery when it begins to hurt; an appendix is also additional material at the end of a book or paper.   You would think that the appendix at the end of a book came after appendix the body part, wouldn't you? After all, our bodies have been around a lot longer than books have. But you'd be wrong. The name for the organ, also known as vermiform appendix, came into use later, no doubt because it is something attached — as its Latin root is translated — to the intestines just as an appendix is attached to the end of a book.          ★☆☆☆☆   In British English, the plural form appendices /ə'pendɪsiːz/ is usually used for meaning 2. 英国英语中，义项2的复数形式通常为appendices /ə'pendɪsiːz/。1[N-COUNT 可数名词]阑尾；盲肠 Your appendix is a small closed tube inside your body which is attached to your digestive system. ...a burst appendix.阑尾穿孔2[N-COUNT 可数名词]（书末的）附录 An appendix to a book is extra information that is placed after the end of the main text.

You can applaud by clapping your hands at a performance, or you can applaud with just your mouth, as when you tell someone ""I applaud your decision to start exercising.""   The verb applaud goes back to the Latin verb applaudere, ""to clap,"" and it came into English use in the 15th century. Part of the word applaud is laud, which means ""praise,"" and laud is close in spelling to loud. When you applaud, you give loud praise by clapping you hands together. If you really like what someone is doing and want to pat them on the back for it or show encouragement, you might just say ""I applaud your efforts.""          ★★☆☆☆   1[VERB 动词]鼓掌（以示赞赏） When a group of people applaud, they clap their hands in order to show approval, for example when they have enjoyed a play or concert.    [V]   [V n]The audience laughed and applauded...观众边笑边鼓掌。Every person stood to applaud his unforgettable act of courage.所有人起立为他不可磨灭的英勇之举鼓掌。2[VERB 动词]称赞；赞许 When an attitude or action is ap-plauded, people praise it.

(Of course, sometimes applause just means the audience is glad it’s time to go home.)   Back in ancient Rome, actors requested applause from the audience by declaring “Plaudite!” This fact sheds light on the origin of applause — and it definitively proves that performers have been seeking approval from audiences for millennia. Oddly enough, however, it’s considered inappropriate to applaud between the movements of a piece of classical music, regardless of how much you enjoyed the performance. Some concertgoers choose to defy this rule, in spite of the nasty looks they get from neighbors.          ★★☆☆☆   1[N-UNCOUNT 不可数名词]掌声；喝彩 Applause is the noise made by a group of people clapping their hands to show approval.

You appreciate the quality of the popcorn at the movie theater because it is significantly better than what you make at home. Of course, appreciable differences aren't always appreciated.

The word arctic refers to the Arctic Circle — the North Pole and the land that surrounds it — which is the northernmost major circle of latitude on the Earth.

From the Latin assumptionem, meaning “a taking or receiving,” assumption was recorded circa 1300 as a noun describing “the reception of the Virgin Mary into heaven.” The word later shook its religious roots and developed into the noun we hear more often today, usually when a person takes something for granted or literally takes possession of something.          ★★★☆☆   1[N-COUNT 可数名词]假定；假设；臆断 If you make an assumption that something is true or will happen, you accept that it is true or will happen, often without any real proof.

It’s the noun form of astonish, which is a verb meaning, basically “to have your mind blown.” A professional magician aims to create astonishment. A basketball player who hits every three-point shot might make fans feel astonishment. Many people feel astonishment when looking at something like the Grand Canyon.

The Ancient Greeks used the word astron for ""star,"" so it only makes sense that astronomy would involve the study or the stars (and other unearthly topics). Someone who studies or works in astronomy is an astronomer, and one of the main tools of the trade is the telescope. As telescopes get more and more powerful, astronomers learn more and more about what's going on out there, such as how old a star or planet is. If you ever wondered what's out there besides the Earth, you should learn more about astronomy.          ★☆☆☆☆   1[N-UNCOUNT 不可数名词]天文学 Astronomy is the scientific study of the stars, planets, and other natural objects in space."

When you see the chemical formula for water, H2O, it's telling you that each molecule of water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.   In science class, you've probably come across atoms, the bits that make up molecules. Less scientifically, the word atom can also mean a very small piece of anything at all. The Greek root of atom is atomos, which means ""indivisible,"" since the scientists who first gave the atom its name imagined it couldn't be split or divided into smaller pieces. Even though we know there are smaller things that make up an atom (protons, neutrons and electrons), it's still a good way to think about the word atom.          ★★☆☆☆   1[N-COUNT 可数名词]原子 An atom is the smallest amount of a substance that can take part in a chemical reaction.

Attachment brings things together.   Attachment is a word that's equal parts mechanical and emotional. Many gadgets — such as cameras and tractors — have attachments that allow them to get more done, like a tractor attachment for plowing snow. People have attachments to bands, political movements, sports teams, hobbies, and each other.

(1) 装配过程的这一部分现在是全自动的。 (2) 许多银行已开始采用自动化技术。                When you design a machine to complete a process once done by a human, you automate the process. Standardized tests once had to be graded by hand, now they're automated, i.e. done by computers.   If you automate a factory, workers might lose jobs to robots and machines. A century ago, if you did laundry, you had to turn the clothes in the drum by hand. It was really hard work, so hard that in many families one day was set aside as laundry day and everyone had to help. In 1937, the first electric, or automated, washer was sold, with a motor that turned the drum. Since then, the job has become much easier, though most of us still find it a chore.          ★☆☆☆☆   1[VERB 动词]使自动化 To automate a factory, office, or industrial process means to put in machines which can do the work instead of people.

Sometimes avail is used to mean ""help,"" and in that case it can be used in a sentence like ""Nothing seemed to avail me, not even winning the lottery."" More often though, avail shows up in the company of ""oneself of,"" as in the sentence, ""I hope you avail yourself of my advice, because I'm very wise.""

Suddenly she just fell down beside me... Share prices fell sharply during the day. Do not confuse fall and drop. Although things  can drop or fall by accident, note that fall is not followed by an object, so you cannot say that someone 'falls' something. However, you can say that they drop something, or that something drops. Leaves were falling to the ground... He dropped his cigar... Plate after plate dropped from his fingers. You say that a person drops when they jump straight down from something, for example, when someone jumps from a plane using a parachute. If someone falls it is usually because of an accident. He stumbled and fell. Drop and fall are also nouns. A drop is the height of something when you imagine falling off it. Sixteen hundred feet is a considerable drop. A fall is what happens when someone has an accident. I had been badly bruised by the fall. 注意 fall down 既可用于人亦可用于物，但如谈到价格一类的事物就只能单独用动词 fall。如：Suddenly she just fell down beside me (她突然在我身旁倒下了)，Share prices fell sharply during the day (股票价格在白天暴跌)。不要将 fall 与 drop 混淆。fall 和 drop 均可表示意外掉落，但 fall 后不跟宾语，因此不能说 someone falls something, 但可以说 someone drops something 或 something drops，如: Leaves were falling to the ground (叶子纷纷落下)，He dropped his cigar (他将雪茄扔掉)，Plate after plate dropped from his fingers (一个又一个碟子从他指间滑落)。drop 可表示从某处跳下，如使用降落伞从飞机上跳下。但如说某人fall，则一般表示意外摔倒。如:He stumbled and fell (他绊了一下，摔倒了)。drop 和 fall 均可作名词。drop 指想象从某处掉落的高度，如：Sixteen hundred feet is a considerable drop (1, 600 英尺是个相当大的落差)。fall 则指意外摔倒，如：I had been badly bruised by the fall. (我摔得青一块紫一块)。3[VERB 动词]See also:rainfall；snowfall；(雨或雪)落下，下落 When rain or snow falls, it comes down from the sky.

We see frequent fluctuations in the stock market, as prices go up or down, and also in the weather, which is always changing.   The original form of the word fluctuation appeared as a mid-15th-century French word derived from the Latin fluctuationem, meaning ""vacillation."" The verb stem fluctuāre meant ""to undulate,"" referring to waves, giving rise to the idea of change and movement that is at the heart of the word. It might help to remember that fluctuation has the same root as the word fluent, and to think of it as something flowing, with frequent change along the way."

(2) It is unwise to be hasty in generalization. (3) This is, of course, only a simple generalization. (4) This sweeping generalization is the law of conservation of energy. (5) So the generalization ability of the system is more important.

It's a generalization to say all dogs chase squirrels.   A generalization is taking one or a few facts and making a broader, more universal statement. If all the girls you know play with dolls, you might make the generalization that all girls play with dolls. Scientists try to make generalizations based on research — the more data they have, the more accurate the generalization.

Generalizing makes large points, though they aren't always necessarily true.   When someone says ""in general"" they're talking about what things are like in the big picture or overall. Similarly, generalizing takes small examples and uses them to make bigger points. Saying that all teens are selfish because you know a few selfish teens is generalizing. Saying all adults are uptight is an example of generalizing. Unfortunately, generalizing can be dangerous. Stereotyping is a form of generalizing.

Generosity is a quality — like honesty and patience — that we all probably wish we had more of. When you show generosity, you might give away things or money or put others before yourself.

When you use gesture, you are entering into a whole history of human communication, because there is no language that exists entirely without gesture (a fun fact to bring up at parties). People can't communicate without gesture.

If you ask the chef to make it a vegan dish that doesn’t include chicken stock, however, then you’re making a request that it’s up to the chef to grant — or not.          ★★★★☆   1[N-COUNT 可数名词]拨款；补助金 A grant is an amount of money that a government or other institution gives to an individual or to an organization for a particular purpose such as education or home improvements.

The verb grumble is a great example of onomatopoeia, a word that sounds just like what it means. When you say ""grumble"" out loud, you're practically already grumbling about something. The origin of grumble is the Middle French word grommeler, or ""mutter through the teeth."" Just think about the things in life that make you want to mutter through your teeth and you'll probably start to grumble.          ★☆☆☆☆   1[VERB 动词]抱怨；发牢骚 If someone grumbles, they complain about something in a bad-tempered way.

A grunt is a short, deep sound.   If you think about the noise a pig makes, you'll have a good idea of what a grunt sounds like. It's an animal-like sound that people make when they're inarticulate, angry, sullen, or lazy — or sometimes if they're hurt or afraid. Pigs and other animals grunt too, no matter what their moods may be. The Old English root word, grunnettan, most likely came from the sound of a grunt.          ★☆☆☆☆   1[VERB 动词]（尤指因为烦恼或不感兴趣）咕噜，嘟哝着说 If you grunt, you make a low sound, especially because you are annoyed or not interested in something.

Feelings of guilt are typical after you've done something you shouldn't have, like cheating on your spelling test or stealing from your little brother's piggy bank. We often say that our conscience is the source of this feeling.

A telltale sign that someone has visited Paris is the tiny, metal Eiffel Tower hanging from her keychain as a souvenir.   First recorded in 1775 as meaning “a remembrance or memory,” the noun souvenir stems from the French souvenir “to remember, come to mind.” A few years later, it took on the sense of “a token” of an event or experience. A song by Tears for Fears goes, “Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.” Here, souvenir refers to a feeling, but more often it refers to something tangible, like a memento, gift, or trophy.          ★☆☆☆☆   1[N-COUNT 可数名词]纪念品；纪念物 A souvenir is something which you buy or keep to remind you of a holiday, place, or event.

Spacious is an adjective that means ""roomy,"" or ""having plenty of room.""   The adjective spacious is most commonly used to describe living quarters that have plenty of space, but it can be used to describe other things as well. A luxury sedan, for example, might be said to have a spacious interior. Spacious can also be used to mean “having an expansive scope.” A spacious novel, for instance, would be a novel that deals with a broad range of characters and issues. Don’t confuse spacious with specious, which means something that sounds true but is actually false.          ★☆☆☆☆   1[ADJ-GRADED 能被表示程度的副词或介词词组修饰的形容词]广阔的；宽敞的 A spacious room or other place is large in size or area, so that you can move around freely in it.

Instead, it is an explicit detail of a design, presenting the exact way something specific must be constructed. For example, blueprints contain the specifications for a building.   In the 17th century, the word specification emerged with the meaning of giving something a specific quality. The technical meaning, applied to building and engineering plans, developed in the late 18th century. The meaning of the word is precise, referring to specific plans, although just because it's a specification doesn't mean it is accurate.

The noun specimen comes from the Latin word specere, meaning “to look.” Biologists collect specimens so they can get a better look at something to study it. The idea is that, with a good specimen, you can learn about an entire group: it's a good representation. That meaning is echoed in the slang use of specimen, a strong, healthy and attractive person.          ★★☆☆☆   1[N-COUNT 可数名词](动植物的)标本 A specimen is a single plant or animal which is an example of a particular species or type and is examined by scientists.

Get on top of your desk at work in your underpants playing the kazoo and you're making a spectacle of yourself.   The word spectacle comes from the Latin spectaculum meaning ""public show,"" an apt translation because a spectacle, like a public show, is something worth watching. A ballet is a spectacle, or an elaborate production worth watching. Often the word is used to describe something that has a particularly exciting visual element to it — like an acrobatic display or a magic trick.

Our modern definition of spectrum started out in the 1600s, when scientists used it to refer to the band of colors formed by a beam of light, like a rainbow. In physics, it’s a word that describes the distribution of something, like energy or atomic particles. We still use those scientific meanings today, but spectrum can also apply to non-science related groupings or ranges of related things.          ★★☆☆☆   1[N-SING 单数名词]光谱 The spectrum is the range of different colours which is produced when light passes through a glass prism or through a drop of water.

The verb speculate has a specialized meaning in the world of finance — it means to take a financial risk, in the hopes of monetary gain.
