This could be positive (like a dispersal of money) or negative (like a dispersal of a crowd because of a bomb).If you know that dispersing is when something spreads out or separates, then you have a headstart to understanding dispersal. Dispersal causes something to be diffused or disseminated, like the dispersal of seeds in a garden.  A strong wind could cause the dispersal of someone’s homework. A tear gas bomb causes the dispersal of tear gas, which in turn will cause the dispersal of a crowd.

Behaving badly one day when you're usually on your best behavior is a lapse; behaving badly again after a short stint being well-mannered means you're lapsing back into nasty old habits.lapse: lapsed, lapses, lapsing, relapse/relapse: relapsed, relapses, relapsing    lapse"

The Latin word from which it is derived is adaequāre, ""to make something equal to something else."" The English word made its appearance in the early 1800s as a derivative of the adjective adequate. Adequacy means being equal to the requirements of the situation — no more, no less.

The Latin root is paternus, ""relating to a father,"" from pater, ""father.""paternity: paternities/paternal: paternalism, paternally, paternity/paternalism: paternalisms, paternalistic/paternalistic: paternalistically    paternity"

When a music vending machine came along, people called it a jukebox because they could crank up the music and get rowdy. It's a large, cabinet-type device that you put money in and choose a song.

principal: 用于人时，指地位优于其他人；用于物时，指该物在大小、重要性等方面优于他物。  leading: 侧重指具有影响力或凝聚力。从而有主导和引导的作用。  primary: 通常不用于人。用于物时，指在重要性方面占第一位。  foremost: 侧重指在行进或发展过程中居首位。  capital: 着重指因重要性、意义、优越或重大而名列同类之首。  major: 指同其他人或其它物、问题等相比较，显得更加重要和突出。  chief: 拽人时，表同类中职位最高，权力最大；指物时，表同类中最重要，价值最高。  main: 通常只用于物。指在一定范围内，某物的重要性、体积或力量等超过其它物。      Capital is the total amount of money (and things with a monetary value, like houses or cars) that a person or institution owns. A bank's capital might be in the billions, while your capital barely makes it into the hundreds.Capital comes from the Latin capitalis, or ""head,"" which some would argue is the command center of your body. Because your head is so important, capital, as a noun and as an adjective, has come to refer to the primary or chief example of something — whether it's money, a letter, a crime, or the national or state seat of a government. It can be easily confused with the American word capitol, which refers to the buildings where government activities take place.capital: capitalise, capitalism, capitalize, capitally, capitals/capitalisation: capitalisations, overcapitalisation/capitalise: capitalisation, capitalised, capitalising, overcapitalise/capitalism: capitalist, capitalistic/capitalist: capitalists/capitalistic: capitalistically/capitalization: capitalizations/capitalize: capitalization, capitalized, capitalizes, capitalizing, overcapitalize/overcapitalise: overcapitalising/overcapitalize: overcapitalization, overcapitalized    capital"

Loosening the blades on your competitor's ice skates would definitely be considered sabotage.Sabotage comes from the French word saboter, which literally means “walk noisily.” That's funny, because the last thing you'd want to do when committing an act of sabotage is stomp around and get caught. It’s believed that sabotage came into use in 1910 as a noun, and then later in 1918 as a verb. Apparently, people only became so cruel in the last century or so.sabotage: sabotaged, sabotages, sabotaging   sabotage

Sometimes defamation is even a punishable crime, and in every instance it's unkind and malicious.defamation: defamations/defame: defamation, defamatory, defamed, defamer, defames, defaming/defamer: defamers/fame: defame, fames, famous/famous: famouser, famousest, famously    defamation

In the world of cuisine, savory is also often used to mean the opposite of sweet, or salty.The easiest way to remember savory is that it rhymes with flavory — which is not a real word, but should be. Interestingly, the word unsavory — which is clearly the opposite of savory — is almost never used to describe food. If some a dish doesn't taste good, it, well, isn't good-tasting. If something is unsavory, then it's probably a person or situation that seems morally questionable. So, save savory for delicious food and save unsavory for things, people and ideas deserving of the adjective.savory: savories, savorily, savoriness, unsavory/unsavory: unsavorily, unsavoriness    savory

Lotze believed that when you look at a work of art, you project your own sensibilities onto it.  So if you feel sad when you see a painting of a woman weeping over a dying lover, that's because you can imagine what it's like to lose someone you love.  To make the word, Lotze turned to the ancient Greek empatheia, which means ""passion.""empathetic: empathetically/empathize: empathized, empathizes, empathizing/empathy: empathetic, empathies, empathise, empathize    empathetic"

Deliverance often has religious connotations, but the word can be used for other kinds of rescue or liberation. You might want deliverance from the hardship of working on your uncle’s farm all summer, or at least deliverance from the smell of manure.deliverance: deliverances/deliver: deliverable, deliverance, delivered, deliverer, delivering, delivers, delivery/deliverable: deliverables/deliverer: deliverers/delivery: deliveries    deliverance

You can often be found in the library and other quiet places, and if someone compliments you, you're likely to blush and change the subject.If you call someone retiring, it isn't necessarily clear whether you mean it as a compliment or something closer to a put-down. Usually, the word is used to describe someone who is shy or modest to a fault. But it can also be used to suggest that someone isn't arrogant, which is usually a good thing. And, of course, retiring can also refer to someone who stepped down from their last job and doesn't intend to work anymore.retiring: retiringly/retire: retired, retiree, retirement, retires, retiring/retired: retiredly/retiree: retirees/retirement: retirements    retiring

A major goal of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement of the 20th century was desegregation.When you segregate one group of people, you deliberately keep them separate or apart from others. During much of America's history, there has been a policy of segregating African Americans in society — at various times, segregation has existed in the military, housing, jobs, education, and many other areas. Desegregation has attempted to remove this division and to integrate people of all races into the general community.

For centuries humans have believe that dogs are domesticated wolves, but DNA testing reveals that they are in fact a different species.Domesticated comes from domus, the Latin word for home, which is easy to remember — instead of a ""roof over our heads"" think of your ""home as a dome."" Domus gives us not only domesticated (adapted to the home or the farm), but also domestic (cooking and cleaning are ""domestic"" chores), a domestic (someone like a maid who works inside a home as a paid employee), and domicile (a building that serves as a home). Thus domesticated means an animal tamed to live in your home — or, as some women like to joke, a man.domesticated: undomesticated/domesticate: domesticated, domesticates, domesticating, domestication    domesticated"

Although the most common use of annexation is in the sense of a political or military takeover of territory, it can also refer to less major acts of acquisition.

It helps the stomach digest food. It’s a large, long gland that secretes insulin and digestive enzymes.Although the stomach gets the most of the credit for digesting food, it has a helper — the pancreas. The pancreas hides behind your stomach and helps digest and absorb nutrients, and it also helps you maintain a healthy blood sugar level by secreting insulin. This dual function makes the pancreas part endocrine (for the insulin) and part exocrine (for the digestive juices). These two functions make the pancreas important, but you can actually live without it.pancreas: pancreases, pancreatic   pancreas

Mysticism is what lets you transcend the physical to experience enlightenment — let's just say you'll recognize it when it happens.Mystical, mysterious, and filled with wonder, mysticism is easily associated with crystals, New Age theories, or the occult (the supernatural). The truth is that many faiths, including Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity, have their own forms of mysticism, placing an emphasis on spiritual connection and union, and the mysteries of religion over dogma or rigid rules. Outside of religion, mysticism is applied to cryptic, obscure, or irrational thought — leaning toward mystery and wonder, rather than logic.mysticism: mysticisms/mystic: mystical, mystics/mystical: mystically, mysticism    mysticism

Another sense of the word is when something gets mixed up, like if wires get tangled together: that tangle is called a snarl.

For example, a robbery suspect might have his trial dismissed on a legal technicality if the arresting police officer neglected to show him a search warrant before searching his house.technicality: technicalities/technical: nontechnical, technicality, technically, technicals, untechnical/untechnical: untechnically    technicality
