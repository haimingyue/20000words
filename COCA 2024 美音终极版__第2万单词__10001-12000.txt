A caterpillar is one example of a larva — it has hatched from an egg and will eventually become a fully mature butterfly.You may picture a larva as a little grubby white bug, and in many cases you'd be correct. Many insects pass through a larval stage in which they resemble grubs — in fact, grubs are the larva of insects like June bugs and Japanese beetles. Other familiar larvae include tadpoles and maggots. The name, which means ""evil spirit"" or ""terrifying mask"" in Latin, comes from the idea that a larval insect's final form is hidden, or ""masked.""larva: larvae, larval, larvas   larva"

In fact, many English-language newspapers from coast-to-coast include the name gazette in their title, from The Daily Hampshire Gazette in Massachusetts to the Mariposa Gazette in California.The noun gazette comes from the Italian word gazzetta. In the 1600s, there was a Venetian news sheet that became known as a gazeta because it cost a gazeta, a small-valued Venetian coin.

It’s believed that sabotage came into use in 1910 as a noun, and then later in 1918 as a verb. Apparently, people only became so cruel in the last century or so.sabotage: sabotaged, sabotages, sabotaging   sabotage

As an adjective, it’s the opposite of plain. The noun names something that isn’t real. When someone likes or wants something, the verb can be used: “I fancy a cup of tea.” Doesn’t that sound fancy?Fancy is an old contraction of the word fantasy. You’ll often see this word used in the phrase “flights of fancy.” This phrase refers to an unrealistic goal or idea such as, “He has flights of fancy about running off to Hollywood and becoming a movie star.” Fancy can also be used as an expression of affection. If you have a crush on someone, for instance, you could say that you “took a fancy ” to him or her.fancy: fancied, fancier, fancies, fanciest, fanciful, fancily, fancying/fancied: fanciedly/fancier: fanciers/fanciful: fancifully    fancy"

Another kind of gutter is the indentation beside a street curb. Water flows through these gutters too, usually into a storm drain.The purpose of the gutters on a roof is to prevent water damage to a structure or flooding around its foundation. If your house has no gutters, water will run down the roof and drip from its edges. Over time, water can harm your house by rotting wood siding or trim, pooling beside its foundation, and seeping into your basement. A gutter directs the flow of rainwater away from the house, often into a drain or rain barrel.gutter: guttered, guttering, gutters/gut: gutless, guts, gutted, gutter, gutting/gutless: gutlessly, gutlessness/guts: gutsy/gutsy: gutsier, gutsiest, gutsily, gutsiness    gutter

The Latin root word is continuus, ""uninterrupted,"" and if you're truly talking about something going on without pause, you'll want to use the word continuous instead.continual: continually   continual"

That kind of talk is anecdotal: based on small, personal accounts. Anecdotal stories are helpful when you’re trying to give an example of something, but there's a downside to anecdotal information: since it’s not based on facts, you never know if you can totally trust it. So it's best to go beyond the anecdotal and get more solid information.anecdotal: anecdotally/anecdote: anecdotal, anecdotes, anecdotic, anecdotical, anecdotist/anecdotic: anecdotically/anecdotist: anecdotists    anecdotal

Either way, torn things are difficult (and sometimes impossible) to repair.torn: torner/tear: teared, tearful, tearing, tearless, tears, tore, torn/tearful: tearfully, tearfulness/tearing: tearingly, tearings/tearless: tearlessly/tore: tores    torn"

The Latin root is extremus, ""outermost"" or ""farthest.""extremism: extremisms, extremist/extreme: extremely, extremeness, extremes, extremest, extremism, extremity/extremeness: extremenesses/extremist: extremists/extremity: extremities    extremism"

If you're talking about a woman, you would call her a fiancée rather than a fiancé, which is used only to refer to men.

Sewing is the craft of stitching things using a needle and thread. If you enjoy sewing, your elaborate, hand-stitched Halloween costumes might be the envy of all your friends.Before the invention of the sewing machine in the 1800s, sewing was done by hand. This kind of sewing involves threading a needle and taking repeated stitches through fabric, to attach several pieces to each other. The sewing that goes into a modern, mass-produced piece of clothing requires speedy, electric-powered sewing machines doing all the stitching.

If someone gets so angry they lose their temper, you can say that they blew a fuse. But this comes from another meaning of fuse — a device that interrupts the flow of electrical current so the system doesn’t get overloaded. If you use the toaster, microwave and dishwasher at the same time, you might literally blow a fuse.

The soft-drink called Brisk must be called that for a good reason. Perhaps it picks you up!brisk: brisked, brisken, brisker, briskest, brisking, briskly, briskness, brisks   brisk"

In physics, relativity refers to Einstein's theory that time and space are not absolute.If you believe there are absolute, correct answers to everything, you probably don't like relativity, which is the opposite of absolutism. According to relativity, things aren't good or bad in themselves; they only have significance in relation to other things.

Your favorite newspaper can be trustworthy — they always print the truth — and people can be trustworthy too. You only tell your secrets to a trustworthy friend.Breaking apart the word trustworthy gives you a clue to its meaning. It combines the common word trust, which describes something you can rely on, and the word worthy, which describes something that deserves respect. So something — or someone — that's trustworthy deserves your trust. In an election, you'll likely vote for the most trustworthy candidate because you believe she'll keep her promises. If you're trustworthy, that means you're reliable: you do what you say you're going to do.trustworthy: trustworthily, trustworthiness, untrustworthy/untrustworthy: untrustworthiness    trustworthy

When you discipline children, you are either teaching them to be well-behaved, or you are punishing and correcting them.The origins of this word offer great clues about its current meanings. The Old French descepline referred to punishment and suffering. The Latin disciplina meant ""teaching, learning."" The Old English version referred to a branch of knowledge or field of study (so if you're really good at word origins, you might want to make etymology your discipline).

Squid can swim extremely fast by sucking in water and propelling it out (just like jet propulsion), and their skin can change color so they blend in with their surroundings. Squid squirt a kind of dark ink to confuse predators; some language experts believe that squid was once sailors' slang for squirt.squid: squids   squid

But this comes from another meaning of fuse — a device that interrupts the flow of electrical current so the system doesn’t get overloaded. If you use the toaster, microwave and dishwasher at the same time, you might literally blow a fuse.

The best antonym is cosmopolitan, which implies the sophistication and worldliness of city life.rustic: rustically, rusticate, rusticism, rusticity, rustics/rusticate: rusticated, rusticates, rusticating, rustication/rustication: rustications/rusticity: rusticities    rustic"

If you're referring to, say, how much money a movie made, that's the noun gross; but remember, the gross is how much the movie made in total, not how much it cleared in profit after expenses (the net).

Nobody owns the commons, and when some part of it becomes privately owned, it's called privatization.
