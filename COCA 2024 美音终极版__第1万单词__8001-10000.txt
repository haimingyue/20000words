Although still referring to something under something else, around 1850 the meaning of the verb shifted to include something that makes a foundation for something else.

If you put so much pepper in your soup that you can't taste the other spices, then you caused an imbalance in your flavoring.It’s easy to remember the meaning of imbalance when you break the word into parts. You might recognize the prefix im- as a way to say “not.” Combine that with the familiar word balance, and you come up with something that is decidedly out of whack, or not balanced. It means that something is out of proportion, such as a trade imbalance between nations, meaning the amount of goods they sell to one another is not equal.imbalance: imbalanced, imbalances/balance: balanced, balancer, balances, balancing, counterbalance, imbalance, microbalance, overbalance, unbalance/balanced: balancedly/balancer: balancers/balancing: balancings, self-balancing/counterbalance: counterbalanced, counterbalances, counterbalancing/overbalance: overbalanced, overbalances, overbalancing/unbalance: unbalanced, unbalances, unbalancing    imbalance

Both are adjectives and both are concerned with the law. If something is legal, it is allowed by the law, whereas if it is statutory, it is regulated by law. In the negative, this is easier to understand. If something is not legal, the law says you can't do it. If something is not statutory, there are no laws regulating it.statutory: statutorily   statutory

Hopefully organized sports are both. A sporting chance means a player in a game has a fair chance of winning. A good sport is someone who plays fair, and wins and loses graciously.

If you can’t get those yummy Swedish fish, perhaps there has been an embargo on trade with Sweden!The fact that ships cannot move during an embargo makes sense from the Latin root of the word, a verb meaning impede with barriers. If one government places a trade embargo on another, it can be an act of war between the two countries. But if an arms embargo is in place, many countries refuse to sell arms to a particular country because it is especially violent. As a verb, the use of embargo is a little broader. If you write an impassioned plea for peace, but the government embargoes it, no one will read your writing.embargo: embargoed, embargoes, embargoing, embargos   embargo

Before you initiate retaliation on someone who has wronged you, consider whether he or she might have a ninja alter ego and a set of nunchucks stashed away.The noun retaliation stems from the Latin retaliare, meaning “pay back in kind.” Notice the word kind in that definition. Retaliation used to have both good and evil connotations. Now, though, it’s important to read that kind as synonymous with type or sort because retaliation has since lost its positive sense. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, “Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.”retaliation: retaliations/retaliate: retaliated, retaliates, retaliating, retaliation, retaliator, retaliatory/retaliator: retaliators    retaliation

Did you foresee your team winning the playoffs, or were you surprised?Think of foresee as “to see before.” Prophets in literature are able to foresee events that come to pass; in Greek mythology Tiresias is known for his ability to foresee the future. But foresee is not always linked to a supernatural sense. Regular people can foresee events by imagining them taking place — and sometimes we use this as a way of prevention.

People often turn to repression because they're scared of what will happen if they say what's on their mind. Unfortunately, political and emotional repression can often lead to anger and even violence.repression: repressions/repress: repressed, represser, represses, repressing, repression, repressive/repressed: repressedly, unrepressed/represser: repressers/repressing: repressingly/repressive: repressively    repression

If your doctor tells you to eat more vegetables, cut out potato chips, exercise, and take vitamins, she is prescribing a regimen for better health.It's easy to confuse regimen with regime. While both words can refer to an organized plan for diet, exercise, or medical therapy, only regime can refer to a system of government.

Something that is deliberate is done on purpose, not by chance or accident — deliberation carries this same spirit, in that it is a carefully thought-out process of making a decision.deliberation: deliberations/deliberate: deliberated, deliberately, deliberateness, deliberates, deliberating, deliberatingly, deliberation, deliberative/deliberative: deliberatively    deliberation

Bad news from a boss that the company is laying you off is also a dismissal, and when a judge rules that a trial is over and the case has been dropped, it's yet another kind of dismissal. The word comes from dismiss, ""send away,"" from the Latin root dimittere, ""send different ways"" or ""break up.""dismissal: dismissals/dismiss: dismissal, dismissed, dismisses, dismissible, dismissing, dismission, dismissive/dismission: dismissions/dismissive: dismissively    dismissal"

Graze can also mean to scrape, like when you graze your elbow after falling off your bike.Graze means ""to feed on grass"" as sheep, horses, cows, do in a meadow — they eat a little at a time, but constantly. People sometimes graze too, munching on small snacks all day long instead of having a real meal. It also means “to touch lightly,” like when I pitch a baseball to you — and I accidentally hit your arm.

In his play Hamlet, Shakespeare wrote of the villain holding a human skull in his sinister — i.e., left — hand. It would seem to be sinister, or wicked, enough to see a human skull in the right hand, not to mention unlucky for the person missing a head in the first place.sinister: sinisterly   sinister

As a verb, the word has a totally unrelated meaning: to speak or to articulate a sound.If you utter something, you give it voice. You could utter a cry or utter complete sentences; either way, you are expressing yourself.

A corrupt and greedy government makes its citizens impoverished, and too much pollution will create impoverished soil that isn’t healthy enough to grow delicious vegetables.impoverish: impoverished, impoverishes, impoverishing, impoverishment/impoverishment: impoverishments    impoverished

The word originally meant, and still means, a female dog.This word for a female pooch has evolved to a more common meaning: a woman you don't like. In those cases, a bitch is kind of a female jerk, although feminists would argue that the term often gets unfairly thrown at any strong willed, assertive woman. Many males call each other bitch, too, implying that the other guy is a weakling.
