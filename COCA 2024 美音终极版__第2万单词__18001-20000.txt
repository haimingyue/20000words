These buildings  were notorious for catching fire and collapsing. In 1901, New York City passed a law that said all tenement apartments had to have running water — ah, indoor plumbing! — and required that each room have a window.tenement: tenements   tenement

A frown expresses sadness, but a scowl expresses disdain.scowl: scowled, scowling, scowls/scowling: scowlingly    scowl"

Along those lines, English poet Sir Thomas Overbury, who died in 1613, once said, ""The man who has nothing to boast of but his illustrious ancestry is like the potato — the best part underground."" However, the word can also be used in a positive way: a town can boast a new library, or a school can boast a high graduation rate.boast: boasted, boaster, boastful, boasting, boasts/boaster: boasters/boastful: boastfully, boastfulness/boasting: boastings    boast"

Stocky has evolved since then to describe people with bodies ""like tree trunks.""stocky: stockier, stockiest, stockily   stocky"

But when something piques your interest or curiosity, here the verb pique just means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.Both the noun and verb are pronounced ""pēk"" and were borrowed from a French word meaning ""a prick or irritation,"" from Old French piquer, ""to prick.""

But the word was first used to describe multicolored fabric, especially the type of material used in a jester's costume. This distinctive apparel was a sign of the fool's place outside the class system — and, in the Elizabethan era, it signified that the jester was beyond the sumptuary laws that determined who could wear what.

But the process of oxidation — a word that looks very much like the word oxygen — isn't limited only to metals. Bananas turn brown over time because of the oxidation process. If you see an old car crumbling from all its rust, it's seen its fair share of the oxidation process.oxidation: oxidations/oxidate: oxidated, oxidating, oxidation, oxidative    oxidation

The word’s original associations, however, have nothing to do with talent and everything to do with how a person treats the protégé — the source of the word means “protection.”protege: proteges   protege

Some animals, like cats, typically have hours of inactivity every day.Your inactivity might be a symptom of boredom or exhaustion, since it's characterized by slowness, sluggishness, and a general lack of energy and motion. Inactivity in the middle of the night is perfectly normal, but your daytime inactivity will make it difficult to get anything done. The noun inactivity adds the prefix in-, ""not"" or ""opposite of"" to activity, which comes from a Latin root, actus, ""a doing, a driving, or an impulse.""inactivity: inactivities/act: actable, acted, acting, action, active, actor, actress, acts, actuate, counteract, enact, interact, overact, underact/actable: unactable/acting: actings, self-acting/action: actionable, actioned, actions, inaction/activate: activated, activates, activating, activation, activator, deactivate, reactivate/activating: self-activating/activation: activations/activator: activators/active: activate, actively, activeness, activer, actives, activest, activity, hyperactive, inactive, overactive, underactive/activity: activities/actor: actors/actress: actresses/actuate: actuated, actuates, actuating, actuation, actuator/actuator: actuators/counteract: counteracted, counteracting, counteraction, counteractive, counteracts/counteraction: counteractions/deactivate: deactivated, deactivates, deactivating, deactivation/enact: enacted, enacting, enactment, enacts, reenact/enactment: enactments/hyperactive: hyperactively, hyperactivity/inaction: inactions/inactivate: inactivated, inactivates, inactivating, inactivation/inactive: inactivate, inactively, inactiveness, inactivity/interact: interacted, interacting, interaction, interactive, interacts/interaction: interactional, interactions/interactive: interactively/overact: overacted, overacting, overacts/overacting: overactings/overactive: overactivity/reactivate: reactivated, reactivates, reactivating/reenact: reenacted, reenacting, reenactment, reenacts/reenactment: reenactments/underact: underacted, underacting, underacts    inactivity"

Yes, but other words containing the prefix bi- are even more troublesome.

When used outside of the courtroom, summation simply means recounting a group of items or events. At the end of a father-son camping trip, the son gives his mother a summation of the trip.

If you want the bow of the boat to go starboard (right), for example, you need to move the tiller to the port side (left) and vice versa.

When you recuperate, you heal and recover.Recuperate comes from the Latin word recuperare “to take back,” so when you recuperate you gain something back that was yours before — health or money. Recuperate is usually something people do after an illness. If you break your knee playing rugby in college, you might go home to recuperate. If you don't want to sound fancy, just say you're recovering.

Metaphorically, unfathomable can refer to something that resembles an abyss, some figurative notion that's so deep you can't even measure it.unfathomable: unfathomably/fathom: fathomable, fathomed, fathoming, fathoms/fathomable: unfathomable/fathomed: unfathomed    unfathomable

If you start bluntly telling people what you think of them, you might see an abatement in their friendliness toward you.Abatement comes from the French word for batter, but abatement doesn’t usually have a negative sense — abatement reduces something, but doesn’t beat it to a pulp. Many cities offer tax abatements to reward businesses starting up in areas they want to develop. If your heat doesn't work, you could sue your landlord for a rent abatement, since you shouldn't have to pay rent for days you don't have heat.abatement: abatements/abate: abatable, abated, abatement, abates, abating, abator/abated: unabated/unabated: unabatedly    abatement

If you and your sister are both extremely opinionated, it must have been hard growing up in the same house — for you and for your parents.

Personal and sexually explicit comments might be acceptable when said in private, but they are not all right when said to strangers in public.Lewd has to do with sexual behavior or remarks that are highly inappropriate or obscene, often because of what's done or said is in public or to someone who does not want that kind of attention. The couple who might make sexually suggestive jokes in private with each other would be completely out of place doing the same thing in the supermarket. What's more, committing a lewd act or making inappropriate comments is socially — and legally — unacceptable, and it can even land the perpetrator in jail.lewd: lewder, lewdest, lewdly, lewdness/lewdness: lewdnesses   lewd

Fortunately, it's not a real monster. It's a grotesque carved beast sticking out from the gutter of a building, especially in Gothic architecture.If you've ever seen a statue of an ugly beast coming out of the side of the building, you've seen a gargoyle. There aren't a lot of pretty, friendly looking gargoyles in the world; they usually look frightening, strange, and grotesque (which is kind of a mix of really ugly and kind of bizarre). Gargoyles have a couple purposes. For one thing, they're part of the drainage system that keeps the building from flooding. Secondly, they're so nasty-looking that they should scare off evil spirits who would do harm to the building or the people inside. Too much water and too much evil are both bad for a building.gargoyle: gargoyles, gargoylism   gargoyle

The sun reaches its zenith when it is as high in the sky as it is going to go on that day.Zenith — and its opposite, nadir — have been appropriated by non-astronomers and are used to describe high and low points in non-astronomical contexts.

But gnarled means rugged, roughened and knotty, like the hands of an old wood carver, as well as the wood he carves.We owe the adjective gnarled and other forms of the word to our friend Shakespeare, who created it in 1603. In “Measure for Measure,” he writes, “Thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt splits the un-wedgable and gnarled oak.” But gnarled didn't come into use again until the 19th century. In any case, word experts believe it's related to the Middle English word knar which means “knot in wood.”gnarl: gnarled, gnarling, gnarls, gnarly   gnarled"

Without buttresses supporting the walls and carrying the weight of the ceiling away from the building and down to the ground, this cathedral would be impossible. Picture this when you use buttress figuratively as a verb meaning to strengthen and support.buttress: buttressed, buttresses, buttressing   buttress"

In the late 15th century, gold and silver was rubbed, or touched against black quartz — the touchstone — to determine the purity of the metals. This was done by looking at the color of the streaks left on the stone. This is why a touchstone, in the figurative sense as it is used today, is a measuring tool.touchstone: touchstones   touchstone

During World War II, the American government put Japanese-Americans in internment camps, fearing they might be loyal to Japan.Internment usually doesn’t involve a trial, so you're being held because someone thinks you might be dangerous, but there’s no proof. The internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II is now widely considered to have been a terrible mistake, in that the citizens who were detained — some for as long as four years — were not traitors, but loyal Americans, and their internment caused them considerable emotional and economic hardship.

As a verb, the word has a totally unrelated meaning: to speak or to articulate a sound.If you utter something, you give it voice. You could utter a cry or utter complete sentences; either way, you are expressing yourself.

To incapacitate someone is to cause him or her to be unable to function normally, like a bad cold that incapacitates you.The verb incapacitate is related to the word capacity. Capacity comes from the Latin word capacitas, meaning “that can contain,” or how much something — brain, bucket or otherwise — can hold. The prefix in- reverses the meaning and when the suffix -ate is added, incapacitate means someone has been made unable to “contain” much — like attention, effort, or energy.incapacitate: incapacitated, incapacitates, incapacitating/capacious: capaciously, capaciousness/capacitate: capacitated, capacitates, capacitating, incapacitate/capacity: capacious, capacitate, capacities, incapacity/incapacity: incapacities    incapacitate"

That resemblance is why the brain structures known as the hippocampus major and hippocampus minor have that name: they look kind of like seahorses too. The hippocampi are found on the floor of your brain's ventricles, and they are vital to feeling and remembering.

It's durable enough to withstand red hot metals and repeated hammer blows, but you don't want your foot to be under if it falls off the table.We most often associate anvils with metalworking (or cartoon coyotes standing in the wrong place at the wrong time), but did you know that there is also a tiny bone in the middle ear called the anvil? It works with other small bones to transmit vibrations that allow us to hear noises. Scientists also call this bone the incus, but it got the name anvil because of its similarity to the blacksmith’s tool. They may be the same shape, but the bone weighs a few milligrams, while the tool can weigh hundreds of pounds.anvil: anvils   anvil
