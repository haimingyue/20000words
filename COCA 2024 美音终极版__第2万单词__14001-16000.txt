The definition of utopia was later broadened to imply any perfect place. The opposite of utopia is dystopia, coined in 1868 by J.S.

The news that their favorite teacher has been fired might enrage a group of students, and witnessing someone mistreating an animal might also enrage them. The 14th century verb enrage combines the prefix en-, ""make or put in,"" and rage, with its Latin root rabies, ""madness, rage, or fury.""enrage: enraged, enragement, enrages, enraging/enraged: enragedly/rage: enrage, raged, rages, raging/raging: ragingly    enrage"

So if your friends want you to go to a wild party and you don't want to, you should tell them your mom won't let you. That way, they will be mad at her and not at you. A fall guy is similar to a scapegoat, but it is mostly used if your scheme has been found out and one of your group of schemers must take the consequences.scapegoat: scapegoats   scapegoat

Which basically means it’s a birthday party.Here’s something you might not know: the word jubilee comes from the Hebrew word yobel, which means “ram’s horn trumpet.” If you’ve ever celebrated the Jewish New Year, it’s possible you've heard a ram’s horn trumpet played to mark the jubilee. In Judaism, the Jubilee Year is a year of freedom from enslavement which is celebrated every fifty years. But that horn gets played every year.

Reverberate means sound waves traveling back and forth, as in an echo.Often we use reverberate to talk about sound, or sometimes light. If a noise echoes for a long time, we can say the space reverberates with that noise. You may have heard of a reverb effect in audio processing, which is basically a long echo. We also use the word metaphorically to describe the impact of huge events.

So robbery is one thing, but aggravated robbery is not only robbing someone, but also causing physical harm, and the punishment would be harsher than for simple robbery.

If you're cramming for exams, take an occasional walk to give yourself a respite from the intensity.Respite may look like it rhymes with despite, but this word has a stress on its first syllable (RES-pit).  It comes from the Latin word respectus, meaning refuge, but we almost always use respite to describe a time, not a place, of relief.

If you use this word as a verb, it means to draw back in fear or pain. You might quail in fear at the sight of a playground bully.

This adjective comes from the verb tax, which means ""to put a strain on.""taxing: taxingly/overtax: overtaxed, overtaxes, overtaxing/tax: overtax, supertax, taxable, taxation, taxed, taxer, taxes, taxing/taxable: nontaxable, taxability/taxation: taxations/taxed: untaxed/taxer: taxers    taxing"

If you spread false rumors that there's chicken stock in the vegetarian entree at Joe's Diner, you would sully Joe's good reputation.Sully can also mean to tarnish or make spotty. It's easy to remember this meaning when you know that sully comes from the Middle French word souiller, meaning, ""make dirty."" For example, dripping chocolate sauce onto the table will sully your mother's new white tablecloth. Another meaning of sully is to corrupt or cast suspicion on. If an automaker recalls millions of vehicles due to safety problems, it doesn't exactly inspire confidence — in fact, it may sully their brand.sully: sullied, sullies, sullying/sullied: unsullied    sully"

A pet snake is easy to care for, unless you're squeamish about feeding it mice.Like other reptiles, snakes are covered in smooth scales. Unlike most, snakes have flexible jaws that allow them to eat things much wider than their own narrow bodies — if you see a big lump in the middle of a garter snake's body, you can be pretty sure it's just eaten a mouse. Because so many people are afraid of snakes (the vast majority of which are not poisonous), the word has also come to mean ""treacherous or deceitful person."" Snake is a verb as well, meaning ""move like a snake.""snake: snaked, snakelike, snakes, snaking, snaky/snaky: snakier, snakiest, snakily    snake"

The suade part that both words share has origins in the Latin root suadēre, meaning “to urge.” In the case of persuade, the prefix per- means “thoroughly,” intensifying “to urge” and giving persuade its meaning of “to convince.” Think of dissuade as the opposite of persuade: the prefix dis- reverses the action of the root, giving the meaning of not urging, in other words, convincing someone NOT to do something.dissuade: dissuaded, dissuades, dissuading, dissuasion, dissuasive/dissuasion: dissuasions/dissuasive: dissuasively    dissuade

The threads going lengthwise are called the warp and the crossing fibers are the weft.

When they break up, they disband. The word disband refers to any group or unit of folks who decide to go their separate ways.Long before there were rock bands, groups of friends or warriors would band together for protection or companionship. They would become a band of sorts. The prefix dis comes from the Latin word for ""apart."" So if people come together to form a band — like Robin Hood's Merry Men — then if they disband, they decide to separate and break apart. Groups don't always disband because they want to.

The word modular has been used this way since the 1930s — earlier, it was a purely mathematical term, from the Latin word modulus, or ""small measure.""modular: modularly/module: modular, modules    modular"

For example, if you are selling your house, your real estate agent acts as the middleman between you and the buyer.Anyone whose job involves buying and re-selling can be called a middleman, although sometimes the thing being sold is some kind of service rather than physical goods. One example of a middleman is a wholesaler who buys fruit and vegetables from farmers and then distributes them to large supermarkets. While sometimes it makes more sense for farmers to sell directly to stores, a middleman can simplify the process.middleman: middlemen   middleman

At best it's used to convey a person's satisfaction: ""Oh? No one asked you to the prom? I've been asked three times,"" she said with complacency. More commonly, however, it takes on a political tone, as with large bodies of people who are unwilling to protest corruption because it doesn't touch them: ""He preached and argued, but it was impossible to jostle the students from their complacency.""complacency: complacencies/complacent: complacence, complacency, complacently, self-complacent/self-complacent: self-complacency    complacency"

If you get teary-eyed upon hearing about the death of your friend's pet hermit crab, you're probably empathizing with your friend — unless you're just bored to tears by her story.Empathize is often used interchangeably with sympathize, but you'll get no empathy (or sympathy) from usage experts if you confuse the two. When you sympathize with another person, you feel sad that she is suffering, but you don't necessarily relate to her experience. It's easiest to empathize when you've been through a similar experience; for example, if your pet guppy had recently passed away, your friend's hermit crab story would have broken your heart due to empathy.empathize: empathized, empathizes, empathizing/empathetic: empathetically/empathy: empathetic, empathies, empathise, empathize    empathize

When something's inconclusive, it doesn't resolve your questions and leaves room for debate. If you're a detective, the last thing you want to hear is that your evidence is inconclusive.inconclusive: inconclusively, inconclusiveness/conclude: concluded, concludes, concluding, conclusion, conclusive/conclusion: conclusions/conclusive: conclusively, conclusiveness, inconclusive    inconclusive"

The word started off as a noun for deep sadness, from a rather disgusting source. Back in medieval times, people thought that secretions of the body called ""humors"" determined their feelings, so a depressed person was thought to have too much of the humor known as melancholy — literally ""black bile"" secreted from the spleen.

When one thing magnifies the effect of another, together they have synergy.

It can also affect neighborhoods. Urban blight refers to a part of the city where things are falling apart.Blight rhymes with bright, but it’s the opposite of sunshine; instead of making plants grow, it cripples them. The Irish Potato Famine was an example of a blight. In 1845, more than a third of the potato crops were ruined. The plants turned black and their leaves dried up and people who relied on potatoes for most of their meals also withered and experienced extreme hardship and hunger. You might want to think of it this way: a blight makes people — or plants — fight for their lives.blight: blighted, blighter, blighting, blights/blighter: blighters    blight

Relativism is the belief that there's no absolute truth, only the truths that a particular individual or culture happen to believe. If you believe in relativism, then you think different people can have different views about what's moral and immoral.Understandably, relativism makes a lot of people uncomfortable. Is it morally okay for some cultures to have slaves, for example? Cultural relativists might argue yes. Einstein, in particular, caused a lot of problems with his Theory of Relativity that stated that even time and space were relative concepts depending on where an observer happened to be. Of course, you might argue that relativism itself is a belief only a certain individual or culture happens to believe in.

Mistrust, on the other hand, is a more general sense of suspicion.mistrust: mistrusted, mistrustful, mistrusting, mistrusts/distrust: distrusted, distrusting, distrusts, self-distrust/distrustful: distrustfully, distrustfulness/entrust: entrusted, entrusting, entrusts/intrust: intrusted, intrusting, intrusts/mistrustful: mistrustfully/trust: antitrust, distrust, entrust, intrust, mistrust, trusted, trustee, truster, trustful, trusting, trusts, trusty/trusted: trustedly/trustee: trustees, trusteeship/trusteeship: trusteeships/truster: trusters/trustful: distrustful, trustfully, trustfulness/trusting: trustingest, trustingly, trustingness, untrusting/trusty: trustier, trusties, trustiest, trustily, trustiness, untrusty/untrusty: untrustiness    mistrust"

You can also appraise the value of a quarterback on your fantasy football team by looking at the statistics for his completed passes.appraise: appraisal, appraised, appraiser, appraises, appraising, reappraise/appraisal: appraisals, overappraisal/appraiser: appraisers/appraising: appraisingly/reappraisal: reappraisals/reappraise: reappraisal, reappraised, reappraising    appraise"

When still is an adverb, it means even now, like when you say you still love an old song or you still remember the kindness of your kindergarten teacher.still: stilled, stiller, stillest, stilling, stillness, stills/stillness: stillnesses    still

Knead is sometimes used to describe a cat’s behavior of repeatedly pushing its paws (and claws) into soft surfaces — almost like it’s kneading dough. We’re pretty sure cats did the same thing long ago when folks spoke Old English, but there’s no word on whether knead was used to describe this behavior back then.knead: kneaded, kneading, kneads   knead

The word started off as a noun for deep sadness, from a rather disgusting source. Back in medieval times, people thought that secretions of the body called ""humors"" determined their feelings, so a depressed person was thought to have too much of the humor known as melancholy — literally ""black bile"" secreted from the spleen. Fortunately, we no longer think we're ruled by our spleens, and that black bile has been replaced by another color of sorrow: the ""blues.""melancholy: melancholies, melancholily   melancholy"
