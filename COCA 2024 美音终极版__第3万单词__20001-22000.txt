You might meet sporadically with your cousins, usually on minor holidays like Memorial Day or Flag Day.Sporadically comes from the Greek word sporadikos, meaning scattered, with the root word spora, which means sowing. Imagine sowing seed by scattering it, and you'll get the hit-or-miss sense of sporadically. There is no pattern to the frequency of an event that occurs sporadically. Working sporadically is hard because you lack a steady income and never know when you'll be busy, but traveling sporadically can be fun.sporadic: sporadically   sporadically

A patient only has a pacemaker implanted when his own heart isn't working well on its own.The human heart has a natural pacemaker that makes it beat at an appropriate rate to keep blood flowing throughout the body. Sometimes it doesn't work right, because of some kind of blockage or other problem that causes the heart to beat too slowly. In these cases, cardiologists — or heart doctors — will often surgically implant an electronic pacemaker as a replacement. Pacemaker research began in 1899, but it wasn't until 1958 that the first patients received these lifesaving devices.pacemaker: pacemakers   pacemaker

Venison is deer meat intended as food.Venison is derived from the medieval French word venesoun, which originally described the meat of any large animal, not just deer. Back then, venison was as common as a Big Mac today (rather than as the fairly classy meal it's considered today). In Britain, before 1066, when the French came over and conquered them, the Brits had pretty simple names for their meat: cow, pig, deer, etc. The French, with their high regard for cuisine, changed all that, and the names became beef, bacon, and venison. The British, though, despite the fancy new names, famously refused to take cooking as seriously as their new French rulers.venison: venisons   venison

When an old building needs to be removed to make way for new structures, implosion is often used as a controlled way to destroy it.A real scientific implosion happens when the pressure inside and outside of an object vary so much that the object is crushed, or collapses in on itself. This can happen, for example, to a submarine under water or to a collapsing star in the galaxy. The implosion of a building involves careful small explosions that make the middle fall as the sides collapse inwardly.implosion: implosions/implode: imploded, implodes, imploding, implosion    implosion"

If you hitchhike, you typically stand beside a road or highway with one thumb pointed up. The hope for a hitchhiker is that a car will stop and its driver will provide a free ride. While for many people, hitchhiking was once considered a reasonable way to travel, today it's illegal in some places and generally thought of as dangerous.

That period’s word ālīhtan had an original meaning of dismounting, or lightening the load on the horse, and so is the ancestor of the verb we use today that means ""to settle or perch.""  Meanwhile, the word onlīhtan (see the different spelling?) of that same time meant to be on fire, which became our adjectival use of the word.alight: alighted, alighting, alights   alight"

Hyperbolic statements are tiny dogs with big barks: don’t take them too seriously.Hyperbolic is an adjective that comes from the word hyperbole, which means an exaggerated claim.  The Greek root huperbolē means “excess,” and broken down even further the word literally translates as “throw above.”  Imagine tossing a football to a friend, but you throw it way above their head and onto a roof.  That’s an excess of throwing, and it’s not necessary, which is exactly what being hyperbolic is all about: making statements bigger than necessary.hyperbolic: hyperbolically/hyperbole: hyperboles, hyperbolic, hyperbolise, hyperbolize/hyperbolize: hyperbolized, hyperbolizes, hyperbolizing    hyperbolic

You can externalize your fears in a constructive way by writing about them or drawing them, which will help you make sense of them. This is a much better solution than internalizing your fears, because you need to face them and deal with them once and for all.

The noun accretion, on the other hand, implies an accumulation that causes increase, such as ""an accretion of frost on the windows"" or ""an accretion of plaque on your teeth.""

When a government or company classifies something as top-secret, it's either because revealing it could harm people or because it could harm business interests.

I shall pull a rabbit out of my hat!”Have you ever heard ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder""? That can help you remember that to behold is to see something and to hold it in your attention. To behold is to look intensely — it’s much more than a glance. A good example of beholding is when you take the time to check out something special like that beautiful sunset, or a bunny hopping out of a hat and handing out candy.behold: beheld, beholder, beholding, beholds/beholder: beholders/beholding: beholdings    behold"

A candy bar might give your hunger temporary appeasement, but eventually you'll need a real meal.The noun appeasement comes from the verb appease, which itself comes from the French words a (""to"") and pais (""peace""). We wouldn't use appeasement to talk about deep inner calm, but rather satisfying demands, or bringing a turbulent situation back to calm, and in a way that often meets with disapproval. The ransom of $50,000, for instance, is an appeasement for the kidnappers.appeasement: appeasements/appeasable: unappeasable/appease: appeasable, appeased, appeasement, appeaser, appeases, appeasing/appeaser: appeasers/appeasing: appeasingly/unappeasable: unappeasably    appeasement"

Although patri- might look related to the Latin pater""father,"" it actually comes from the Greek patria""family."" Presumably, it was assumed that such a person would be a man.

When you make an extrapolation, you take facts and observations about a present or known situation and use them to make a prediction about what might eventually happen.Extrapolation comes from the word extra, meaning “outside,” and a shortened form of the word interpolation. Interpolation might sound like a made-up word, but it’s not. An interpolation is an insertion between two points. So an extrapolation is an insertion outside any existing points. If you know something about Monday and Tuesday, you might be able to make an extrapolation about Wednesday.extrapolation: extrapolations/extrapolate: extrapolated, extrapolates, extrapolating, extrapolation    extrapolation

It doesn’t even have to be from an actual force. You might recoil when you see a snake, or recoil at the thought of having to eat squid. In those cases it’s more like a cringe or a flinch from something that’s scary, disgusting, or painful. Eating squid might in fact be all of those things to you.recoil: recoiled, recoiling, recoilless, recoils/coil: coiled, coiling, coils, recoil, uncoil/uncoil: uncoiled, uncoiling, uncoils    recoil

No creature like that has ever existed, but the idea seemed real and terrifying to Greeks, and that’s another meaning: an idea that feels real but is impossible, like the idea of a world without evil.

So, shallow describes something that is close to the surface — like the shallow roots of a newly-planted tree or a person whose interest in someone or something isn't very deep. For instance, a shallow person might go to the opening of a new art exhibition not so much to see the artworks as meet the wealthy people on the museum's board of trustees.shallow: shallowed, shallower, shallowest, shallowing, shallowly, shallowness, shallows/shallowness: shallownesses    shallow"

If you would rather work through your feelings in your diary than have a conversation, then you are an introvert.Introvert comes from Latin intro-, ""inward,"" and vertere, ""turning.""  It describes a person who tends to turn inward mentally. Introverts sometimes avoid large groups of people, feeling more energized by time alone. The opposite of an introvert is an extrovert, who finds energy in interactions with others.

Most darkrooms are kept by photographers who work with black-and-white film. In the darkroom, the enlarger projects an image from a negative onto photographic paper, which is then immersed in a developer chemical wash and a fixer wash, and hung to dry.

In the 1600s, many of Shakespeare's plays were printed in the form of a folio.The word folio means ""leaf or sheet of paper"" in Latin. A folio is made by folding one piece of paper in half — counting each side, this gives you four pages. A larger folio is simply a collection of many folded sheets bound together. In the early days of printing, the fanciest books were folios. Another method was the quarto, with two folds in each sheet and pages that had to be cut open after they were bound.folio: folios   folio"

In some cases, being exposed to a disease can also immunize you; if you've had chicken pox, you are most likely immune to it and won't get it again.
