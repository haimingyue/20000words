Violas, like violins, are played by holding them beneath your chin, putting your fingers on the strings to form notes, and pulling the bow across them. The name comes from viol, a Renaissance instrument, which may stem from Vitula, the Roman goddess of joy.

In the world of cuisine, savory is also often used to mean the opposite of sweet, or salty.The easiest way to remember savory is that it rhymes with flavory — which is not a real word, but should be. Interestingly, the word unsavory — which is clearly the opposite of savory — is almost never used to describe food. If some a dish doesn't taste good, it, well, isn't good-tasting. If something is unsavory, then it's probably a person or situation that seems morally questionable. So, save savory for delicious food and save unsavory for things, people and ideas deserving of the adjective.savory: savories, savorily, savoriness, unsavory/unsavory: unsavorily, unsavoriness    savory

When the pontiff visits a city, thousands of people come out to watch his motorcade go by.In ancient Rome, a pontiff was one of many high-ranking religious authorities — in fact, there was a whole group of them, known collectively as the College of Pontiffs. Today, it's strictly accurate to call any Catholic bishop a pontiff, but the vast majority of Catholics reserve the word for the Bishop of Rome, otherwise known as the Pope. The word means ""high priest,"" from a root meaning ""bridge-maker.""pontiff: pontiffs, pontifical/pontifical: pontifically, pontificals    pontiff"

To manipulate the boundaries like this — often viewed as unfair — is to gerrymander.The verb gerrymander first appeared in 1812 when Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry redrew district boundaries, hoping it would help his party in an upcoming senate election. Then somebody noticed that the new district looked like a salamander, so they combined Gerry and -mander to create the new word gerrymander. And then a newspaper printed a cartoon with a giant salamander making fun of Gerry, which is what happens to politicians who don’t behave.gerrymander: gerrymandered, gerrymandering, gerrymanders   gerrymander

If you want to rankle a cat, try splashing it with water and then putting it in the bathtub.Rankle goes back to the French verb rancler, which comes from an old word for ""festering sore,"" which paints a pretty negative picture of what it means to rankle. A sore that festers gets worse and worse, or more infected, and if you rankle someone, they will get more and more angry.

Calling something or someone fictive suggests it has been invented for a special purpose, such as a character in a story that makes a point about society in general.

A naval fleet at sea is like an army on land.One meaning of fleet comes from the Old English fleot, meaning “ship,” “raft,” or “floating vessel.” Although a fleet is usually a group of ships or airplanes operating under the same ownership, any group of vessels sailing together can be called a fleet, even you and your friends in a fleet of kayaks. Another meaning of fleet originates in the Old English flēotan, which means “moving swiftly.” When it’s used in that way, it’s usually in the -ing form, fleeting.fleet: fleeted, fleeter, fleetest, fleeting, fleetly, fleetness, fleets/fleeting: fleetingest, fleetingly, fleetingness    fleet

Nightclubs use strobes to make dancers appear as though they're moving in slow motion, and car mechanics use them to improve a car engine's efficiency by measuring its rotation. The Greek root strobos means ""a twisting.""strobe: strobes   strobe"

The plants turned black and their leaves dried up and people who relied on potatoes for most of their meals also withered and experienced extreme hardship and hunger. You might want to think of it this way: a blight makes people — or plants — fight for their lives.blight: blighted, blighter, blighting, blights/blighter: blighters    blight

So these days it's safe to assume that a raunchy movie, for example, is full of foul language, obscenities, and graphic sex scenes. And in case you're wondering, an R-rated movie is much more likely to be raunchy than a G movie.raunchy: raunchier, raunchiest, raunchily/raunch: raunchy   raunchy

Ever since, kudzu has appeared along highways and roads, and crept into yards and gardens throughout North America.kudzu    kudzu

Toward the end of that century, the term was used in music, suggesting a use of harmonies and melodies based on other than the standard major and minor scales, in a style found in medieval liturgical music.

Sometimes something that's suppressed is also oppressed — that is, harshly put down or brutally controlled, like a suppressed minority group. Both suppressed and oppressed come from the same Latin word, opprimere, meaning ""to press against, or crush.""suppressed: suppressedly, unsuppressed/suppress: suppressed, suppresser, suppresses, suppressing, suppression, suppressive, suppressor/suppresser: suppressers/suppression: suppressions/suppressor: suppressors    suppressed"

Applied to humans, it is the state of being less than fully-grown, or at least of acting in a childish or silly manner.With the Latin word immātūritās meaning ""unripeness,"" as in a piece of fruit that is not yet fully developed, we can see the meaning of the modern word immaturity. Nowadays, the word is applied more often to people than to fruit, usually in referring to foolish behavior. Although the word is most often used to refer to adolescent behavior, it can still be applied to a physical state of development. And of course, it can still be applied to underripe produce.immaturity: immaturities/immature: immaturely, immatureness, immaturity/maturate: maturates, maturating, maturation/maturation: maturational/mature: immature, maturate, matured, maturely, maturement, matureness, maturer, matures, maturest, maturing, maturity/maturity: maturities, post-maturity    immaturity"

Modern industry, the growth of cities, and reactions to World War I were all factors that affected modernists' break with the old style. Modernist painters included the Impressionists (like Manet and Monet).

You may loathe the tedium of eating dinner with the family — after all, what is more boring than talking to mom and dad, especially if you could be texting friends?The noun tedium comes from the Latin root word taedere, meaning to weary of, and that's still what tedium means today: bored and weary of it all. The noun can also mean a tedious period of time — school concerts and assemblies are always two hours of tedium. Tedious is a related adjective form of the word.

Strictly speaking, doubleheaders occur in succession, one immediately following the other, but the term is often used for any two games played in one day by a single team.doubleheader: doubleheaders   doubleheader

While proscribe means forbid, prescribe is used when a doctor recommends a medicine or remedy. Of course, if you want an excuse for not following your doctor’s orders, you could say you were confused about the meaning of these two words — but that would be lying, which is proscribed by most people’s value systems.

Umber is a dark brown or reddish-brown pigment that is found in certain minerals. Ever since humans started creating art, they've been using umber.Pigments are the shades of color that painters and other artists use, and when they occur naturally, they're called earth pigments. Umber falls into this category — its rich, deep brown shade comes directly from minerals (raw umber) or from minerals heated to a darker shade (burnt umber).

More broadly, it is the idea that people should prioritize the good of society over the welfare of the individual.Collectivism — so closely related to the word collection — has to do with political theories that put the group before the individual. In a collectivist system, power should be in the hands of the people as a whole, not in the hands of a few powerful folks. Collectivism is the opposite of individualism. Ideally, in a collectivist society, decisions benefit all the people.

The most common use of the term is the annulment of a marriage, which not only ends the marriage, but legally makes it as if the marriage never happened.

If you are shopping at the mall on a weekend afternoon and you see an empty parking space, you should make a beeline for it or risk circling the lot for hours.The word beeline combines the words bee and line. The idea behind the word is the belief that a bee, when it is done feeding, will take the shortest path back to its hive without delay or meandering. So beeline not only has the sense of being a direct route, but also that there is some haste behind the action. If you make a beeline for the chocolate at a party, you went straight to the dessert table without eating dinner first.beeline: beelines   beeline

If the project you're working on has been harried from start to finish, you'll be lucky to keep your sanity.harried: harriedly/harrier: harriers/harry: harried, harrier, harries, harrying, harrys    harried
