Football is a game in which players, wearing helmets and protective padding, run while holding the ball and pass by throwing it to teammates, and occasionally try to kick the ball through the goalposts. Players also smash into each other, hence the helmets and padding. Soccer, also known as football, involves players kicking the ball with their feet — only the goalkeeper can touch it with her hands. In both sports, at some point a foot hits the ball.          ★★★★☆   1[N-UNCOUNT 不可数名词]足球运动 Football is a game played by two teams of eleven players using a round ball.

In formal English, you can talk about a garment. Clothing is a more formal word that is used to refer to a person's clothes. He took off his wet clothing. ...prison clothing. You can refer to a garment less formally as a piece of clothing, an article of clothing, or an item of clothing, but in ordinary conversation you usually just name the piece of clothing you are talking about. Cloth is material made from something such as cotton, wool, or nylon. A cloth is a piece of cloth that is used, for example, for cleaning or wiping things. Note that the plural, cloths, is used only for this second sense. For the different verbs associated with clothes, see the note at wear.注意 clothes 没有单数形式，所以不能说 a clothe。在正式用语中，可以说 a garment。clothing 表示所穿的衣服，是一个更正式的词：He took off his wet clothing (他脱下湿衣服)，prison clothing (囚衣)。在不太正式的场合，可以用 a piece of clothing, an article of clothing 或 an item of clothing来指a garment, 但在日常会话中，通常说出所指服装的名称。cloth 指棉、羊毛、尼龙等制成的布。a cloth 是指用来清洁、擦拭等的一块布。注意复数 cloths 只用于第二个义项。与 clothes 连用的动词，请参见 wear 词条下的说明。"

You can listen to music, listen for the sound of your guests arriving, or listen to the advice your grandfather gives you. The phrase listen in means to eavesdrop on, or deliberately overhear, a conversation. The t in the middle of the word listen is silent (you can't hear it even if you listen).          ★★★★☆   1[VERB 动词]（注意地）听 If you listen to someone who is talking or to a sound, you give your attention to them or it.

[feelings]Listen here, young lady. Don't you call me that!你给我听着，小姐。别那样叫我！Usage Note :Do not confuse listen and hear. If you want to say that someone is paying attention to something they can hear, you say that they are listening to it. He turned on the radio and listened to the news. Note that listen is not followed directly by an object. You must always say that you listen to something. However, listen can also be used on its own without an object. I was laughing too much to listen. You use hear to talk about sounds that you are aware of because they reach your ears. You often use can with hear. I can hear him yelling and swearing. 不要混淆 listen 和 hear。listen to 表示注意听， 如：He turned on the radio and listened to the news（他打开收音机听新闻）。注意listen不能直接跟宾语，只能说listen to something。不过，listen亦可不带宾语单独使用，如：I was laughing too much to listen（我当时笑得太厉害了，根本没听）。hear 用来表示听见已经传到耳朵里的声音。它常与can连用，如：I can hear him yelling and swearing（我能听到他在大叫大骂）。相关词组：listen in

A doorbell, a fire alarm, a cat's meow, or your brother's snoring — they’re all sounds.   Long Island Sound is another kind of sound — it’s a branch of the Atlantic Ocean that runs between Connecticut and Long Island, New York. When you don’t know a word, you might sound out the syllables — say them aloud — to figure out the pronunciation. Sound can also mean ""solid or good."" Sound advice is good advice. Sound investments are secure. When you have a sound sleep, it's restful and uninterrupted — at least until your alarm sounds.          ★★☆☆☆   1. NOUN AND VERB USES 名词和动词用法2.

You cannot say, for example, 'They discussed', 'I discussed with him', or 'They discussed about politics'. Instead, you can say that you have a discussion with someone about something. I had a long discussion about all this with Stephen. You can also add an object and say that you discuss something with someone. If the discussion is less formal, you can simply use the verb talk. They come here and sit for hours talking about politics... We talked all night long.注意 discuss 从不用作不及物动词。例如，不能说 they discussed，I discussed with him 或者 They discussed about politics。但可以说 have a discussion with someone about something。如：I had a long discussion about all this with Stephen（我和斯蒂芬就这一切进行了一次长谈）。还可以在 discuss 和 with 之间加宾语，可说discuss something with someone。如果谈话不是很正式，用talk就可以了。如：They come here and sit for hours talking about politics（他们来这儿一坐几个小时谈论政治），We talked all night long（我们彻夜长谈）。"

Some people believe that if you always say “please” and “thanks,” everyone will love you. They’re wrong, but still — say “please” and “thanks.”   The adverb always came about in the mid 14th century. It came from a pair of Old English words, ealne weg, which literally meant ""all the way."" A lot of times when people use the word they're exaggerating. If you routinely roll into work after everyone else has settled down at their desks, you boss might accuse you of ""always"" being late, even if you're only late once or twice a week.          ★★★★★   1[ADV 副词]总是；每次都是；无例外地 If you always do something, you do it whenever a particular situation occurs.

If something always happens, it happens regularly or on every occasion. I would always ask for the radio to be turned down... He's always been an active person. If something is always the case, it is true at all times. No matter what she did, she would always be forgiven.

The may has flowers that can range from white to red, and it's also got deep red berries. Since it has a pretty flower that blooms in the spring, it's associated with the month of May. In the 17th-century poem by Robert Herrick, titled ""Corinna's Going A-Maying,"" Corinna is gathering the flowers of the may tree, a springtime activity that goes back as far as medieval times.          ☆☆☆☆☆   1[N-VAR 可变名词]五月 May is the fifth month of the year in the Western calendar.

In the phrase any one, 'one' is a pronoun or a determiner that can refer to either a person or a thing, depending on the context. It is often followed by the word of. Parting from any one of you for even a short time is hard... None of us stay in any one place for a very long time. In these examples, any one is a more emphatic way of saying any. Anyone or anybody is mainly used in questions and negative sentences. You use not anyone instead of someone in negative sentences. There isn't anyone here... There isn't anybody here.切勿混淆anyone和any one。anyone总是指人，而短语any one中的one可以作代词也可作限定词，根据上下文既可指人也可指物，后面常跟of：Parting from any one of you for even a short time is hard（要离开你们中的任何一人，即使时间很短暂，也是件令人难受的事），None of us stay in any one place for a very long time（我们谁也没有在任何一个地方久留过）。在上述例子中，any one是any的强调性说法。anyone或anybody主要用于疑问句或否定句。在否定句中不用someone，而用not anyone：There isn't anyone here（这儿没有人），There isn't anybody here（这儿没有人）。

The noun library, meaning, “a room or building where books are housed,” comes from the Latin librarium “chest for books.” That, in turn, evolved from the Latin liber, a word meaning “book, paper, parchment,” and, more literally, “the inner bark of trees.” The writer Jorge Luis Borges said, “I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.” What would your vision of paradise look like?          ★★★☆☆   1[N-COUNT 可数名词]（公共）图书馆 A public library is a building where things such as books, newspapers, videos, and music are kept for people to read, use, or borrow. ...the local library...当地图书馆She issued them library cards.她给他们发了借书证。2[N-COUNT 可数名词]（私人）收藏的图书（或唱片等） A private library is a collection of things such as books or music, that is normally only used with the permission of the owner.

The roots of the word clever, are unknown. It was in use colloquially long before it entered the literary record, and this may be a factor in the word's enduring suppleness.

Now, clever still means ""agile"" or ""adroit,"" but it refers to mental, rather than physical, skill. Clever can also be used to describe the products of a nimble mind, such as a ""clever scheme"" or a ""clever device.""          ★★★☆☆   1[ADJ-GRADED 能被表示程度的副词或介词词组修饰的形容词]聪明的；聪颖的；智商高的 Someone who is clever is intelligent and able to understand things easily or plan things well.

It can also mean to position or prepare something for action, or, simply, to lay eggs.   The word lay can mean a lot of different things, but one of its most common uses is as the adjective component of layperson, which refers to someone who's not a member of the clergy, or who's not a member of a particular profession and so cannot always understand that profession's technical jargon. This is why we sometimes request things to be communicated in ""lay language,"" meaning simple, everyday terms that a layperson can understand.          ☆☆☆☆☆   1. VERB AND NOUN USES 动词和名词用法2. ADJECTIVE USES 形容词用法Part-1In standard English, the form lay is also the past tense of the verb lie in some meanings. In informal English, people sometimes use the word lay instead of lie in those meanings.在标准英语中，lay亦作动词lie某些义项的过去式。而在非正式英语中，人们有时用lay来代替这些义项中的lie。Usage Note :Do not confuse the verb lay with the verb lie. Because lay is used to talk about putting something in a particular place or position, it is related to the verb lie. If someone lays something somewhere, it lies there. The past tense and past participle of lay are both laid and it is usually a transitive verb. They laid him on the floor. However, lie is an intransitive verb with the past tense lay and the past participle lain. I lay on the floor with my legs in the air. 不要混淆lay和lie这两个动词。lay表示将某物放于某处或某个位置，意思上与动词lie有相关之处。如某人把某物安放（lay）在某处，此物即放（lie）在那里。lay的过去式和过去分词均为laid，它通常用作及物动词。例如，They laid him on the floor（他们把他放在地上）。lie则为不及物动词，其过去式为lay，过去分词为lain：I lay on the floor with my legs in the air（我躺在地上，双腿抬起）。1[VERB 动词]放置；安放；搁 If you lay something somewhere, you put it there in a careful, gentle, or neat way.

Discover is a slightly more formal word than find, and is often used to talk about scientific research or formal investigations. For example, you can discover a cure for a particular disease. You can also use discover when you find something by accident. This well-known flower was discovered in 1903. If you cannot see something you are looking for, you say that you cannot find it. You do not use 'discover' or 'find out' in this way. I'm lost — I can't find the bridge. You can say that someone finds out facts when this is easy to do, but you cannot use 'discover' or 'find' in this way. I found out the train times.discover, find, find out 都可以用于描述获知事实情况：He discovered the whole school knew about it...（他发现整个学校都知道这件事了），The young child finds that noise attracts attention...（小孩子发现吵闹能吸引注意力），We found out that she was wrong（我们发现她错了）。discover 比 find 稍正式，并常用于谈论科学研究和正式的调查。例如，可以用于表示发现治疗某种疾病的方法，还可以指偶然间的发现：This well-known flower was discovered in 1903（这种著名的花是 1903 年发现的）。找不到某物用 cannot find somthing, dicover和 find out 则无此用法。如：I'm lost — I can't find the bridge（我迷路了，我找不到那座桥了）。find out 可以指弄清很容易就发现的事实，但 discover 和 find 则无此用法：I found out the train times（我查到了列车时刻表）。"
