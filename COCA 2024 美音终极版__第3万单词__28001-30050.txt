If your bedroom looks like a hurricane just hit it, you might describe it as a muddle.Oftentimes, we create the muddles in our lives, so it’s appropriate that muddle can be used as a verb meaning “to mix up” or “confuse.” Conveniently, though, the word muddle also describes a way out of difficult situations; to muddle through a troublesome task is to somehow figure it out, even if you don’t quite know what you’re doing. It has been suggested that muddle comes from an old Dutch word meaning “to make muddy.”muddle: muddled, muddles, muddling/muddled: muddleder    muddle

Around the turn of the 20th century, the word began to be used for combustion engines that couldn't get started because their fuel wouldn't ignite. Figuratively, misfire is good for describing ideas that don't ignite: ""I'm afraid my plan to talk my parents into taking us to Disney World may misfire in the end.""misfire: misfired, misfires, misfiring/counterfire: counterfires/fiery: fierily, fieriness/fire: counterfire, fiery, fired, fires, firing, misfire/fired: firedest/firing: firings    misfire"

An amortization schedule for your car loan will show exactly how much you owe and how long it’ll take to pay it.Amortization is fancy way to describe a payment plan: you gradually pay off a specific amount by making small payments according to a set schedule. Amortization takes place over a specific period of time. The root of amortization can be traced to the Middle English word amortisen, meaning “to kill.” In this case, it’s a debt that’s being killed off — slowly, over time. The word is often applied to car or home loans.amortization: amortizations/amortize: amortization, amortized, amortizes, amortizing    amortization

Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are widely practiced forms of monotheism.Monotheism comes from the combination of the Greek prefixes monos-, “alone” or “single,” and theo-, “god.” There are many words that come from the Greek base theo-: theology, polytheist, and atheism, to name a few.  All of these theo- words have to do with god, gods, or the study of religion. Monotheism is any religion that believes in one god. Buddhism, for instance, isn’t an example of monotheism because Buddha is not considered a god who created the universe.monotheism: monotheisms, monotheist, monotheistic/monotheist: monotheists/monotheistic: monotheistically    monotheism

You may decompress after school by watching TV or taking your dog for a walk.decompress: decompressed, decompresses, decompressing, decompression/compress: compressed, compresses, compressible, compressing, compression, compressor, decompress, uncompress/compressible: compressibility, incompressible/compressing: compressings/compression: compressions/compressor: compressors/decompression: decompressions/incompressible: incompressibility/uncompress: uncompressed    decompress"

You can swindle money, goods, ideas, and anything else that can be stolen, but be careful, because someone can also swindle you.In the late 1700s, the verb swindle formed from swindler, which means “giddy person, cheat.” Swindle can be a noun or a verb. When you get something by less than honest means, that’s a swindle. A successful act of swindle often involves some scheme or rigging of the system. Hollywood loves a good swindle — think of all the movies that show a bank robbery or people lying about who they are.  Another funny word for swindle is bamboozle.swindle: swindled, swindler, swindles, swindling/swindler: swindlers    swindle

Ink is then pushed through this screen onto paper or fabric — this is called screenprinting or silkscreen.printmaking    printmaking

This provides the basis for our word, with the prefix un- providing the turnaround ""not,"" and the suffix -able providing the idea of capability. Therefore, we get “not able to be denied.” Oh, and if you are wondering about the common argument as to whether it is ""un alienable"" or ""in alienable,"" either is correct.unalienable: unalienably/alienable: inalienable, unalienable/alienate: alienable, alienates, alienating, alienation, alienator/alienation: alienations/alienator: alienators/inalienable: inalienably    unalienable"

Maybe you’re wondering when it would be appropriate to kowtow. The answer? When you want to worship, show respect, gain favor, or flatter.

It is a verbal attack that doesn't let up, delivered as a verb or received as a noun. Either way, it's pretty unpleasant.The word harangue developed its modern spelling around 1530, when the word was recorded as harangue in French. The word, meaning a strong, nasty rant, appears to have evolved from the Old Italian word aringa, probably from the word for a public square or place for public speaking. This in turn appears to have evolved from a Germanic word related to ring, as in ""circular gathering,"" which is clearly similar to the Italian meaning.harangue: harangued, haranguer, harangues, haranguing/haranguer: haranguers    harangue"

Early satellites had low apogees, so it wasn’t long before they burnt up in the atmosphere.Apogee comes from two Greek words meaning “away” and “earth,” so it’s specific to things orbiting the earth. If you’re talking about something orbiting the sun, the equivalent word is aphelion, “away” + “sun."" Because apogee denotes the highest point something reaches in an orbit before falling back, it can also figuratively refer to other highs. For example, ""Child stars sometimes reach their apogee by 20, and there's nowhere to go but down from there.""apogee: apogean, apogees   apogee"

Pablo Picasso was one of the most well-known masters of cubism.Cubism began in the early 20th century, when artists started experimenting with abstract works, attempting to show many angles and planes simultaneously. They rejected realistic perspective and tone, not even trying to make their paintings look three-dimensional. Cubism was all about breaking up images and reassembling them into small, flat shapes instead.

In order to have a trait that is expressed by a recessive gene, such as blue eyes, you must get the gene for blue eyes from both of your parents.You might remember the word recessive from biology, where it most often appears. Its opposite is dominant and is always living in its shadow. A recessive allele has to team up with another recessive allele in order to show up. We can also use recessive to describe something that has the tendency to withdraw or recede, or something pertaining to an economic recession.recessive: recessives   recessive

Later, some teachers made children wear pointed paper ""dunce caps"" when they misbehaved.dunce: dunces, duncish   dunce"

The art of serenading one's love comes from the French tradition of courtly love that began in the Middle Ages. Things have changed, though, since the days of the wandering minstrel or jongleur. Our wooing is more private, our entertainment more public, and our terminology has become more practical: We now call our troubadours ""singer-songwriters"" or ""recording artists.""troubadour: troubadours   troubadour"

If you love tons of decoration and fancy details, then you'll love the rococo style of architecture and music.Modern design is all simplicity: clean lines and no clutter. Rococo design — which came and went in Europe in the 1700s — is the opposite: it explodes with detail, ornament, patterns, and decoration. If something other than an actual work of design or music is described as rococo, it means wildly detailed, to the point of excess.

Both Catholic and Protestant religions have prelates in their ranks.The source of prelate is the Latin adjective praelatus, ""noble,"" whose meaning is appropriate to the modern meaning, a high-level church dignitary. The word was applied to those high-ranking clergymen around the beginning of the 13th century, the Middle English coming from the Middle French prelat. As the church's importance increased, so did the importance implied by the word prelate. Ambrose Bierce referred to a prelate as ""one of Heaven's aristocracy.""prelate: prelacy, prelates/prelacy: prelacies    prelate"

As a modern verb, pillory means both to criticize harshly and to expose to public ridicule. Someone who is caught doing something immoral may be pilloried and people who believe they have been unfairly criticized say they have been pilloried, but often only after they've been exposed!pillory: pilloried, pillories, pillorying   pillory

You'll often hear it used with the word jetsam, which refers to floating objects that have been thrown from a ship, usually to lighten it before it sinks.You can keep flotsam and jetsam straight by remembering that flotsam looks like the word, float, and jetsam looks like jettison which means to cast off. Usually it doesn't matter though as flotsam and jetsam are used together as an expression, mostly figuratively to mean things or people who are unwanted or discarded. What about the things that are cast from a ship but sink to the ocean floor instead of floating? That's called lagan.flotsam    flotsam

Someone who’s a phony isn’t sincere, like your classmate who pretended to be your best friend just to try to steal your boyfriend.phony: phonier, phonies, phoniest, phonily   phony

That means you force the desire to be more subtle so you can continue listening — even if you don't want to.Psychologists use the verb sublimate to describe the process of channeling intense energy into something useful or appropriate. Freud sublimated his desire to live at home with his mother, and he moved into his own apartment. Sublimate is related to the word sublime — both words come from the Latin word sublimare, which means ""to raise up"" or ""to exalt.""
